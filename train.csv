"OBJECTIVE: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth retardation. We examined whether a common genetic variant atchromosome 15q25 rs1051730, which is known to be involved in nicotine metabolism, modifies the associations of maternal smoking with fetal growth characteristics. METHODS: This study was performed in 3,563 European mothers participating in a population-based prospective cohort study from earlypregnancy onwards. Smoking was assessed by postal questionnaires and fetal growth characteristics were measured by ultrasound examinations in each trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: Among mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy (82.9%), maternal rs1051730 was not consistently associated with any fetal growth characteristic. Among mothers who continued smoking during pregnancy (17.1%), maternal rs1051730 was not associated with head circumference.  The T-allele of maternal rs1051730 was associated with a smaller second and third trimester fetal femur length [differences -0.23 mm (95%CI -0.45 to -0.00) and -0.41 mm (95%CI -0.69 to -0.13), respectively] and a smaller birth length [difference -2.61 mm (95%CI -5.32 to 0.11)].  The maternal  T-allele of rs1051730 was associated with a lower third trimester estimated fetal weight [difference -33 grams (95%CI -55 to -10)], and tended to be associated with birth weight [difference -38 grams (95%CI -89 to 13)]. This association persisted after adjustment for smoking quantity. CONCLUSIONS:  Our results suggest that maternal rs1051730 genotype modifies the associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy with impairedfetal growth in length and weight. These results should be considered as hypothesis generating and indicate the need for large-scale genome wide association studies focusing on gene--fetal smoke exposure interactions.","We examined whether a common genetic variant atchromosome 15q25 rs1051730, which is known to be involved in nicotine metabolism, modifies the associations of maternal smoking with fetal growth characteristics.",rs1051730,nicotine metabolism,neutral,zero

"BACKGROUND: Rates of tobacco smoking are significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population. The underlying mechanism for this comorbidity is unclear. One hypothesis is that there are common genetic factors that predispose to both nicotine dependence (ND) and schizophrenia. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the association of the 15q25 gene cluster, the most significant candidate region to date implicated in ND and smoking behavior, with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. METHODS: Five variants in the 15q25 gene cluster (rs951266, rs16969968, rs1051730, rs8040868, and rs17477223) were selected to test for association with schizophrenia diagnosis, bipolar disorder diagnosis, and the presence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Effects of the variants on 15q25 gene expression were analyzed using publically available postmortem brain expression data. RESULTS: A meta-analysis revealed four markers associated with risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder(rs951266, rs16969968, rs8040868, and rs17477223), and with the presence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (rs951266, rs1051730, rs8040868, and rs17477223). The associations were in the same direction as that found for ND. Gene expression analysis indicated an association between genotypes of the rs1051730 variant and CHRNA5 expression in brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and with the rs16969968 and rs17477223 variants in brain. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in the 15q25 gene cluster are associated with risk for schizophrenia/bipolar illness, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and influence CHRNA5 expression in the brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results are consistent with the notion that there are genetic mechanisms common to schizophrenia, ND, and bipolar disorder.","Gene expression analysis indicated an association between genotypes of the rs1051730 variant and CHRNA5 expression in brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and with the rs16969968 and rs17477223 variants in brain.",rs1051730,blood mononuclear cells,positive,weak
"BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in Taiwan. Recent studies have demonstrated that the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) is associated with end-stage renal disease in African Americans. In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the APOE gene might contribute to the development of DN in a Taiwanese population with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: We enrolled 180 patients with T2D found to have DN and 178 age- and sex-matched patients with T2D but without DN. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs7412 and rs429358 and common allele variants in the APOE gene were evaluated to test any association with DN. Multivariate logistic regression testing was used to determine factors associated with the risk of DN. RESULTS: The DN group had lower high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol levels and longer duration of diabetes, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and higher blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, andtriglyceride concentrations than the group with T2D but without DN.

"BACKGROUND: The association between polymorphisms on 15q25.1 and lung cancer has been widely evaluated; however, the studies have yielded contradictory results. We sought to investigate this inconsistency by performing a comprehensive meta-analysis on two polymorphisms (CHRNA3 gene:rs1051730 and AGPHD1 gene: rs8034191) on 15q25.1. METHODS: Data were extracted from 15 and 14 studies on polymorphisms rs1051730 and rs8034191 involving 12301/14000 and 14075/12873 lung cancer cases/controls, respectively. The random-effects model was applied, addressingheterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: The two polymorphisms followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all studies (P>0.05). For rs1051730-G/A, carriers of A allele had a 36% increased risk for lung cancer (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-1.46; P<0.0005), without heterogeneity (P = 0.258) or publication bias (P(Egger) = 0.462). For rs8034191-T/C, the allelic contrast indicated that C allele conferred a 23% increased risk for lung cancer (95% CI: 1.08-1.4; P = 0.002), with significant heterogeneity (P<0.0005), without publication bias (P(Egger) = 0.682). Subgroup analyses suggested that the between-study heterogeneity was derived from ethnicity, study design, matched information, and lung cancer subtypes. For example, the association of polymorphisms rs1051730 and rs8034191 with lung cancer was heterogeneous between Caucasians (OR = 1.32 and 1.22; 95% CI: 1.25-1.44 and 1.05-1.42; P<0.0005 and 0.008, respectively) and East Asians (OR = 1.51 and 1.03; 95% CI: 0.76-3 and 0.47-2.27; P = 0.237 and 0.934, respectively) under theallelic model, and this association was relatively strengthened under the dominant model.

"BACKGROUND: The association between polymorphisms on 15q25.1 and lung cancer has been widely evaluated; however, the studies have yielded contradictory results. We sought to investigate this inconsistency by performing a comprehensive meta-analysis on two polymorphisms (CHRNA3 gene:rs1051730 and AGPHD1 gene: rs8034191) on 15q25.1. METHODS: Data were extracted from 15 and 14 studies on polymorphisms rs1051730 and rs8034191 involving 12301/14000 and 14075/12873 lung cancer cases/controls, respectively. The random-effects model was applied, addressingheterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: The two polymorphisms followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all studies (P>0.05). For rs1051730-G/A, carriers of A allele had a 36% increased risk for lung cancer (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-1.46; P<0.0005), without heterogeneity (P = 0.258) or publication bias (P(Egger) = 0.462).

"BACKGROUND: Human sirtuins are a current hotspot for research in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated whether genetic variants in two members of the sirtuin family, SIRT2 and SIRT3, affected AD susceptibility. METHODS: A genetic case-control study was performed, comprising 534 probable AD cases and 638 nondemented control subjects from the north of Italy and Canton Ticino, Switzerland(discovery population). The study was focused on SIRT2 rs10410544, SIRT3 rs4980329, and SIRT3 rs536715 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination assay or restriction fragment length polymorphism. The SNPsrs7412 and rs429358, mapping within the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction allelic discriminationassay too. In a replication population comprising 756 AD cases and 847 nondemented control subjects, SIRT2 rs10410544, APOE rs7412, and APOErs429358 were genotyped as mentioned previously. RESULTS: In the discovery population, we observed an association between SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele and AD (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.50, P = .02, after correction for sex, age, and APOE ɛ4 genotype). The association between AD and SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele was only present in APOE ɛ4 noncarriers (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.61, P = .03). The replication study did not confirm this evidence. However, the combined analysis on the two cohorts detected the association (adjusted OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02-1.35, P = .02), and only APOE ɛ4 noncarriers were at risk (adjusted OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.02-1.43, P = .03).

"Various studies have linked different genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to different blood lipids (BL), but whether these ""connections"" were identified using cross-sectional or longitudinal (i.e., changes over time) designs has received little attention.

"OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition with a strong genetic etiology, is associated with excess cardiovascular disease (CVD).Dyslipidemia in RA may be driven by inflammation and genetic factors. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is important for the regulation of lipid levels and CVD risk and immune function in the general population. We compared the frequency of 2 ApoE single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in patients with RA and controls, and studied the relationship of ApoE genotypes with lipids and inflammation in RA. METHODS: A total of 387 patients with well-characterized RA and 420 non-RA controls were studied. Two ApoE SNP, rs7412 (ApoE2) and rs429358 (ApoE4), were identified. RESULTS: Genotypic (p = 0.908) andallelic (p = 0.894) frequencies did not differ between RA and controls. Within RA, the E2 allele was associated with the lowest and E4 allele with the highest levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.007), low-density lipoproteins (p = 0.004), and apolipoprotein B (p = 0.009). The E4 allele was also associated with lower C-reactive protein (p = 0.007), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.001), and Disease Activity Score (p = 0.015) compared to the E3 allele. E2 or E4alleles were not associated with CVD in RA, although a trend was observed (p = 0.074). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of ApoE polymorphisms did not differ between patients with RA and controls. ApoE genotypes are strongly linked to inflammation and lipid levels in RA, raising interest in the prognostic implications of ApoE genotypes.","ApoE genotypes are strongly linked to inflammation and lipid levels in RA, raising interest in the prognostic implications of ApoE genotypes.",ApoE,RA,positive,strong
"APOE genotype is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated whether APOE genotype was associated with cognitive function in predominantly middle-aged persons.

"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) functional haplotypes determined by rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs have been extensively studied and found to be one of the most consistent association in human longevity studies. However, the search for longevity-determining genes in human has largely neglected the operation of genetic interactions. METHODS: APOE haplotypes have been determined for 1072 unrelated healthy individuals from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and accounting for the different survival between sexes. The epistasis between APOE haplotypes and Haptoglobin (HP) 1/2 polymorphism was tested according to three-way contingency table analysis by a log-linear model. RESULTS: APOE genotype and haplotype distributions differ significantly along the age classes (Genotype: p=0.014; Haplotype: p=0.005) with APOE*ε4 genotype status and haplotype displaying negative association (Genotype: O.R.=0.377, p=0.002, Haplotype: O.R.=0.447, p=0.005).

"This paper addresses a tenet of the literature on APOE, i.e., the relationship between the effects of the ε4, one of the established genetic risk factor forAlzheimer's disease (AD), and its expression levels as determined by APOE promoter polymorphisms. Five polymorphisms (-491 rs449647, -427 rs769446, -219 rs405509, and ε rs429358-rs7412) were studied in 1308 AD patients and 1082 control individuals from the Central-Northern Italy. Major findings of the present study are the following: 1) the variants -219T and ε4 increase the risk for late onset AD (LOAD) when they are both present in cis on the same chromosome (in phase); 2) the correlation between the haplotype (-219T/ε4) and AD risk persists when the data are stratified by age; 3) thishaplotype likely anticipates the age of onset of the disease.These data, while confirming the association between -219T and AD, highlight the importance of the phase of the alleles for the observed effects on AD risk, suggesting that this information has to be taken into account when assessing the AD genetic risk. Moreover, the data help to clarify the apparent discrepancy that emerges from the genetic analysis where an SNP characterizing thehaplotype responsible for an increased risk for LOAD is coherently associated with a reduced expression of ApoE levels. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of a complex role of   ApoE in the   AD pathogenesis, with positive and negative effects occurring concomitantly according to its expression levels and its protein-protein interactions largely unclarified.","Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of a complex role of   ApoE in the   AD pathogenesis, with positive and negative effects occurring concomitantly according to its expression levels and its protein-protein interactions largely unclarified.",ApoE,AD,positive,weak

"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (ε2/ε3/ε4: rs429358 ε4 allele; rs7412 ε2 allele) is strongly associated with both lipid levels and Alzheimer's disease. Although there is also evidence of milder cognitive impairment in later life in carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, there have been few studies investigating the impact of APOE genotype on cognitive function in children. METHODS: We determined APOE genotype in 5995 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and investigated associations between APOE genotype and plasma lipids (at age 9), IQ (at age 8), memory (at ages 8 and 10), and performance in school attainment tests (at ages 7, 11, and 14). RESULTS: Observed genotype group counts were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ(2)p value = .84). There were strong relationships between APOE genotype and low-density lipoproteincholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, which follow the same patterns as in adults. There was no strong evidence to suggest that APOE genotype was associated with IQ (all p values ≥ .46), memory function (p ≥ .35), or school attainment test results (p ≥ .28). CONCLUSIONS: Although   APOE genotype does have strong associations with lipid levels in childhood, there does <xope>not seem to be meaningful effects on cognitive performance</NegScope>, suggesting that any detrimental effects of the ε4 allele on cognitive function are not important until later life.","CONCLUSIONS: Although   APOE genotype does have strong associations with lipid levels in childhood, there does <xope>not seem to be meaningful effects on cognitive performance</NegScope>, suggesting that any detrimental effects of the ε4 allele on cognitive function are not important until later life.",APOE,cognitive performance,negative,-
"The two genetic polymorphisms, rs7412 and rs429358, that collectively form the e2, e3, and e4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE) are among the most widely studied sequence variants in the genome. The predominant model for testing APOE involves the haplotype combinations of e2, e3, and e4 and has been basis of associations with dementia, atherosclerosis, and serum lipid levels. Here, we demonstrate the functional independence of these two component sites, with rs7412 contributing to the majority of variance in serum LDL (p=10-20), whereas rs429358 alone influences variance in CSF amyloid-ß42 (Aß42) (p=10(-17)). This latter relationship is also reflected in the association of APOE with dementia, where rs429358 strongly influences disease (p=10(-67)), but rs7412 does not. Models based upon e2, e3, and e4 explained less variance for both dementia risk and CSF Aß42 than did rs429358 alone. When adjusted for CSF Aß42, the association of rs429358 with dementia is greatly reduced but remains significant indicating that APOEpolymorphism influences disease by additional mechanisms distinct from Aß42 metabolism. We reach four principal conclusion from this study: 1) rs429358 alone is responsible for the association of APOE with dementia; 2) The association of APOE with dementia is substantially mediated by its effect on CNS Aß42 levels; 3) The association of APOE with dementia is not mediated by its impact on peripheral lipid metabolism; and 4) The dichotomy of effects of rs429358 and rs7412 represents one of the best examples of genetic pleiotropy for complex traits known and illustrates the importance of allelic heterogeneity in APOE.",We reach four principal conclusion from this study: 1) rs429358 alone is responsible for the association of APOE with dementia; 2) The association of APOE with dementia is substantially mediated by its effect on CNS Aß42 levels; 3) The association of APOE with dementia is not mediated by its impact on peripheral lipid metabolism; and 4) The dichotomy of effects of rs429358 and rs7412 represents one of the best examples of genetic pleiotropy for complex traits known and illustrates the importance of allelic heterogeneity in APOE.,rs429358,dementia,positive,moderate

"BACKGROUND: Statins are effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, but variability in response is not well understood. To address this, 5745 individuals from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial were genotyped in a combination of a whole-genome and candidate gene approach to identify associations with response to atorvastatin treatment. RESULTS: A total of 291 988 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1984 individuals were analyzed for association with statin response, followed by genotyping top hits in 3761 additional individuals. None was significant at the whole-genome level in either the initial or follow-up test sets for association with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglyceride response. In addition to the whole-genome platform, 23 candidate genes previously associated with statin response were analyzed in these 5745 individuals.Three SNPs in apoE were most highly associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterolresponse, followed by 1 in PCSK9 with a similar effect size. At the candidate gene level, SNPs in HMGCR were also significant though the effect was less than with those in apoE and PCSK9. rs7412/apoE had the most significant association (P=6x10(-30)), and its high significance in the whole-genome study (P=4x10(-9)) confirmed the suitability of this population for detecting effects. Age and gender were found to influence low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to a similar extent as the most pronounced genetic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Among SNPs tested with an allele frequency of at least 5%, only SNPs in   apoE are found to influence statin response significantly. Less frequent variants in PCSK9 and smaller effect sizes in SNPs in HMGCR were also revealed.","CONCLUSIONS: Among SNPs tested with an allele frequency of at least 5%, only SNPs in   apoE are found to influence statin response significantly.",apoE,statin response,positive,strong
"BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death globally, but specific genetic variants that influence MI and MI risk factors have not been assessed on a global basis. RESULTS: We included 8795 individuals of European, South Asian, Arab, Iranian, and Nepalese origin from the INTERHEART case-control study that genotyped 1536 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 103 genes. One hundred and two SNPs were nominally associated with MI, but the statistical significance did not remain after adjustment for multiple testing. A subset of 940 SNPs from 69 genes were tested against MI risk factors. One hundred and sixty-three SNPs were nominally associated with a MI risk factor and 13 remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Of these 13, 11 were associated with apolipoprotein (Apo) B/A1 levels: 8 SNPs from 3 genes were associated with Apo B, and 3 cholesteryl ester transfer protein SNPs were associated with Apo A1. Seven of 8 of the SNPs associated with Apo B levels were nominally associated with MI (P<0.05), whereas none of the 3 cholesteryl ester transfer protein SNPs were associated with MI (P> or =0.17). Of the 3 SNPs most significantly associated with MI, rs7412, which defines the Apo E2 isoform, was associated with both a lower Apo B/A1 ratio (P=1.0x10(-7)) and lower MI risk (P=0.0004). Two low-density lipoprotein receptor variants, 1 intronic (rs6511720) and 1 in the 3' untranslated region (rs1433099) were both associated with a lower Apo B/A1 ratio (P<1.0x10(-5)) and a lower risk of MI (P=0.004 and P=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen common SNPs were associated with MI risk factors. Importantly, SNPs associated with Apo B levels were associated with MI, whereas SNPs associated with Apo A1 levels were not.

"We evaluated genetic variants of apolipoprotein E (APOE HhaI) and their association with serum lipids in colorectal cancer (CRC), together with eatinghabits and personal history. Eight-seven adults with CRC and 73 controls were studied. APOE*2 (rs7412) and APOE*4 (rs429358) were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. APOE gene polymorphisms were similar in both groups, but the epsilon4/epsilon4genotype (6%) was present only in controls. The patients had reduced levels (mean +/- SD) of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterolfraction (180.4 +/- 49.5 and 116.1 +/- 43.1 mg/dL, respectively) compared to controls (204.2 +/- 55.6, P = 0.135 and 134.7 +/- 50.8 mg/dL; P = 0.330, respectively) indicating that they were not statistically significant after the Bonferroni correction. The APOE*4 allele was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction and increased levels of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction andtriglycerides only among patients (P = 0.014). There was a positive correlation between the altered lipid profile and increased body mass indexes in both groups (P < 0.010).

"OBJECTIVE: The genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is being analyzed in multiple whole genome association studies (WGAS). The GAB2 genehas been proposed as a modifying factor of APOE epsilon 4 allele in a recent case-control WGAS conducted in the US. Given the potential application of these novel results in AD diagnostics, we decided to make an independent replication to examine the GAB2 gene effect in our series. METHODS: We are conducting a multicenter population-based study of AD in Spain. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 1116 Spanish individuals. Specifically, 521 ADpatients, 475 controls from the general population and 120 neurologically-normal elderly controls (NNE controls). METHODS:We have genotyped GAB2 (rs2373115 G/T) and APOE rs429358 (SNP112)/rs7412 (SNP158) polymorphisms using real time-PCR technologies. RESULTS: As previously reported inSpain, APOE epsilon 4 allele was strongly associated with AD in our series (OR=2.88 [95% C.I. 2.16- 3.84], p=7.38E-11). Moreover, a large effect for epsilone 4/epsilone 4 genotype was also observed (OR=14.45 [95% C.I., 3.34-125.2], p=1.8E-6). No difference between the general population and the NNE controls series were observed for APOE genotypes (P > 0.61). Next, we explored GAB2 rs2373115 SNP singlelocus association using differentgenetic models and comparing AD versus controls or NNE controls. No evidence of association with AD was observed for this GAB2 marker (p > 0.17). Toevaluate GAB2-APOE genegene interactions, we stratified our series according to APOE genotype and case-control status, in accordance with the original studies. Again, no evidence of genetic association with AD was observed in any strata of GAB2-APOE loci pair (p > 0.34).

METHODS: The functional polymorphisms, rs429358 and rs7412, in the APOE gene (which together define the epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 alleles), and the Q7R SNP in the STH gene, were genotyped in 369 patients with AD and 289 healthy European-Americans. The associations between these two genes and AD were analyzed in a case-control design. RESULTS: Consistent with previously reported results, the frequencies of theAPOE epsilon4 allele, epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype and epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype were significantly higher in AD cases than controls; the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype frequency was significantly higher in early-onset AD (EOAD) than late-onset AD (LOAD); the frequencies of the epsilon2 allele, epsilon3 allele, epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype and epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype were significantly lower in AD cases than controls. Positive likelihood ratios (LRs+) of APOE alleles and genotypes increased in a linear trend with the number of epsilon4 alleles and decreased in a linear trend with the number of epsilon2 or epsilon3 alleles. There was no significant difference in the STH allele and genotype frequency distributions between AD cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the epsilon4 allele is a dose-response risk factor for AD and the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was associated with a significantly earlier age of onset. Moreover, we found that the epsilon2 allele was a dose-response protective factor for AD and the epsilon3 alleleexerted a weaker dose-response protective effect for risk of AD compared with epsilon2. In a clinical setting,   APOE genotyping could offer additional biological evidence of whether a subject may develop AD, but it is not robust enough to serve as an independent screening or predictive test in thediagnosis of AD. STH variation was not significantly associated with AD in our sample.","In a clinical setting,   APOE genotyping could offer additional biological evidence of whether a subject may develop AD, but it is not robust enough to serve as an independent screening or predictive test in thediagnosis of AD.",APOE genotyping,AD,positive,moderate

"In this study, we investigated whether variants in three key pigmentation genes-  MC1R,   MATP/SLC45A2, and   OCA2--were involved in melanoma predisposition. A cohort comprising 1,019 melanoma patients (MelanCohort) and 1,466 Caucasian controls without skin cancers were studied. A total of 10 polymorphisms, including five functional MC1R alleles (p.Asp84Glu, p.Arg142His, p.Arg151Cys, p.Arg160Trp, and p.Asp294His), two nonsynonymous SLC45A2 variants (p.Phe374Leu and p.Glu272Lys), and three intronic OCA2 variants previously shown to be strongly associated with eye color (rs7495174T>C, rs4778241 G>T, and rs4778138 T>C) were genotyped.

"We have previously shown that a quantitative-trait locus linked to the OCA2 region of 15q accounts for 74% of variation in human eye color. We conducted additional genotyping to clarify the role of the   OCA2 locus in the inheritance of eye color and other pigmentary traits associated with skin-cancer risk inwhite populations.

"By studying the loci that contribute to human longevity, we aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to healthy aging. To identify such loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comparing 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-living families included in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and 1670 younger population controls. The strongest candidate SNPs from this GWAS have been analyzed in a meta-analysis of nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus study, and Danish 1905 cohort. Only one of the 62 prioritized SNPs from the GWAS analysis (P<1×10(-4) ) showed genome-wide significance with survival into old age in the meta-analysis of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls [OR=0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.77), P=3.39 × 10(-17) ]. This SNP, rs2075650, is located in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE ε4 defining SNP rs429358 we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses. As expected, rs429358 associated with metabolic phenotypes in the offspring of the nonagenarian cases from the LLS and their partners. In addition, we observed a novel association between this locus and serum levels of IGF-1 in women (P=0.005). In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE ε4 allele.

RESULTS: Significant associations between the minor allele variants of SNPs HLA-C rs9264942 and HCP5 rs2395029 and a lower viral load at set point could be replicated in the ACS. Moreover, these SNPs were significantly associated with delayed progression to AIDS, AIDS-related death, and a CD4 T-cell count below 400 cells/mul. Both minor allele variants were independent predictors of disease progression, also when a CCR5 Delta32 heterozygousgenotype was included in the analysis. However, predictive value was not independent from viral load and CD4 T-cell count at set point. The SNPs in theRNF39/ZNRD1 gene region were associated with set point CD4 T-cell count but not with disease course in the ACS. CONCLUSIONS: The minor allelevariants of SNPs in the HLA-C and HCP5 gene regions are also in the ACS associated with a lower viral load at set point and additionally with delayed HIV-1 disease progression. The association of these SNPs with the relatively early course of infection may help unravel their mode of action.",RESULTS: Significant associations between the minor allele variants of SNPs HLA-C rs9264942 and HCP5 rs2395029 and a lower viral load at set point could be replicated in the ACS.,rs2395029,ACS,positive,strong
"Background/Aims: Polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) are associated with human obesity and obesity-prone behaviors, including increasedfood intake and a preference for energy-dense foods.

"Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many complex human traits, the susceptibility loci identified so far can explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Among other possible explanations, the lack of a comprehensive examination of gene-gene interaction (G×G) is often considered a source of the missing heritability.

"Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many complex human traits, the susceptibility loci identified so far can explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Among other possible explanations, the lack of a comprehensive examination of gene-gene interaction (G×G) is often considered a source of the missing heritability. Previously, we reported a model-free Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) approach for detecting G×G in both dichotomous and quantitative phenotypes. However, the computational burden and less efficient implementation of the original programs make them impossible to use for GWAS. In this study, we developed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based GMDR program (named GWAS-GPU), which is able not only to analyze GWAS data but also to run much faster than the earlier version of the GMDR program.

"BACKGROUND: Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1051730 and rs16969968, located within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster onchromosome 15q25 locus, are associated with heaviness of smoking, risk for lung cancer, and other smoking-related health outcomes. Previous studies have typically relied on self-reported smoking behavior, which may not fully capture interindividual variation in tobacco exposure. METHODS: We investigated the association of rs1051730 and rs16969968 genotype (referred to as rs1051730-rs16969968, because these are in perfect linkage disequilibrium and interchangeable) with both self-reported daily cigarette consumption and biochemically measured plasma or serum cotinine levels among cigarette smokers. Summary estimates and descriptive statistical data for 12 364 subjects were obtained from six independent studies, and 2932 smokers were included in the analyses. Linear regression was used to calculate the per-allele association of rs1051730-rs16969968 genotype with cigarette consumption and cotinine levels in current smokers for each study.

The likely resulting association between genotype and lung cancer risk was assessed using published data on the association betweencotinine levels and lung cancer risk. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Pooled per-allele associations showed that current smokers with one or two copies of the rs1051730-rs16969968 risk allele had increased self-reported cigarette consumption (mean increase in unadjusted number of cigarettes per day per allele = 1.0 cigarette, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57 to 1.43 cigarettes, P = 5.22 × 10(-6)) and cotinine levels (mean increase in unadjusted cotinine levels per allele = 138.72 nmol/L, 95% CI = 97.91 to 179.53 nmol/L, P = 2.71 × 10(-11)).

Additionally, we challenged the question if the associations are modified by obesity status (BMI ≤25 or >25 kg/m(2)). METHODS: The analyses are made with 22,799 individuals from the Swedish population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer Cohort Study, who were born between 1923 and 1945. To investigate food preference, 27 food groups conducted from a modified diet history method including a 7-day registration of cooked meals and cold beverages were used in the analyses. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing, resulting in a cut-off value for significance level of p<0.002.

"BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with body mass index (BMI)/obesity. OBJECTIVE: As obesity is an independent risk factor for hypertension, the objective of the study was to investigate the associations of obesity susceptibility loci with blood pressure (BP)/hypertension in a population of Chinese children. METHODS: This was a genotype-phenotype association study. Participants included 3077 Chinese children, aged 6-18 years. Based on the Chinese age- and sex-specific BP standards, 619 hypertensive cases and 2458 controls with normal BP were identified. METHODS: BP was measured by auscultation using a standard clinicalsphygmomanometer. RESULTS: Of the 11 SNPs, only FTO rs9939609 was significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP; P=0.034) and three SNPswere significantly associated with diastolic BP (DBP; GNPDA2 rs10938397: P=0.026; FAIM2 rs7138803: P=0.015; NPC1 rs1805081: P=0.031) after adjustment for age, sex and hypertension status.

After additional adjustment for BMI, none remained significant. The genetic risk score (GRS), based on three significant SNPs (FTO rs9939609, MC4R rs17782313, GNPDA2 rs10938397), showed a positive association with SBP (P=5.17 × 10(-4)) and risk of hypertension (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, P=6.07 × 10(-6)).

"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the influence of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene on eating behavior in 412 obese Sardinian children andadolescents. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several susceptibility loci for obesity. Among these, the polymorphisms in theintron 1 of the FTO gene has been found associated to weight gain and obesity in various populations. METHODS: All obese patients were genotypedfor the FTO single nucleotide polimorphysm (SNP) rs9939609. In all subjects we evaluated eating behavior using the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire(CEBQ). RESULTS: We found no differences in eating behavior according to the genotype, either in the entire cohort, or when subjects were subdivided into four different age groups.

"Smokers have a higher prevalence of major depressive episodes and depressive symptoms than the general population, but whether this association is causal, or is due to confounding or reverse causation is uncertain because of the problems inherent in some epidemiological studies. Mendelian randomization, in which a genetic variant is used as a surrogate for measuring exposure, is an approach which may be used to better understand this association. We investigated the rs1051730 single nucleotide polymorphism in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4), associated with smoking phenotypes, to determine whether women who continued to smoke were also more likely to report a low mood during pregnancy. We found among women who smoked pre-pregnancy, those with the 1051730 T allele smoked more and were less likely to quit smoking during pregnancy, but were also less likely to report high levels of depressed mood at 18 weeks of pregnancy (per allele OR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.99, p = 0.034). The association between genotype and depressed mood was limited to women who were smokers prior to pregnancy, with weak evidence of an interaction between smoking status and genotype (p = 0.07). Our results do not support a causal role of smoking on depressed mood, but are consistent with a self-medication hypothesis, whereby smoking is used to alleviate symptoms of depression. A replication study using multiple genetic variants which influence smoking via different pathways is required to confirm these findings and provide evidence that the genetic variant is reflecting the effect of quitting smoking on depressed mood, and is not directly affecting mood.

We investigated the rs1051730 single nucleotide polymorphism in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4), associated with smoking phenotypes, to determine whether women who continued to smoke were also more likely to report a low mood during pregnancy. We found among women who smoked pre-pregnancy, those with the 1051730 T allele smoked more and were less likely to quit smoking during pregnancy, but were also less likely to report high levels of depressed mood at 18 weeks of pregnancy (per allele OR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.99, p = 0.034). The association between genotype and depressed mood was limited to women who were smokers prior to pregnancy, with weak evidence of an interaction between smoking status and genotype (p = 0.07). Our results do not support a causal role of smoking on depressed mood, but are consistent with a self-medication hypothesis, whereby smoking is used to alleviate symptoms of depression. A replication study using multiple genetic variants which influence smoking via different pathways is required to confirm these findings and provide evidence that the genetic variant is reflecting the effect of quitting smoking on depressed mood, and is not directly affecting mood.

"BACKGROUND: The rs1051730 genetic variant within the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster is associated with heaviness of smoking and has recently been reported to be associated with likelihood of stopping smoking. We investigated the potential association of rs1051730 gLLLenotype with reduced likelihood ofsmoking cessation in 2 cohorts of treatment-seeking smokers in primary care in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Data were drawn from 2 clinical trials on which DNA was available. One sample was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of nicotine transdermal patch and the other sample an open-label trial where all participants received nicotine transdermal patch. Smoking status was biochemically verified. Logistic regression was used to assess evidence for association in each sample, and data were combined within a meta-analysis. RESULTS: There was evidence of association of rs1051730 genotype with short-term (4-week) cessation in our open-label trial sample but not our placebo-controlled trial sample. When combined in a meta-analysis, this effect remained. There was no evidence of association at later follow-up intervals. Adjustment for cigarette consumption and tobacco dependence did not alter these results substantially. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, taken together with previous recent studies, provide some support for a weak association between this variant and short-term smoking cessation in treatment-seeking smokers, which does not seem to operate only among those receiving nicotinereplacement therapy.

METHODS: Ten thousand three hundred thirty participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study were genotyped and observed prospectively with up to 18 years of 100% complete follow-up. Smoking behavior was measured at baseline. End points were lung cancer, bladder cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Multifactorially adjusted and genotype-adjusted subhazard ratios for a cumulative tobacco consumption above 40 pack-years versus 0 pack-years were 32.5 (95% CI, 12.0 to 87.7) for lung cancer, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.5) for bladder cancer, 9.4 (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.7) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3 to 1.8) for ischemic heart disease, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4) for ischemic stroke. Among smoking noncarriers and homozygotes, daily tobacco consumption was 16 and 18 g/d (P < .001), cumulative tobacco consumption was 28 and 31 pack-years (P = .003), and smoking inhalation was 71.9% and 78.1% (P < .001), respectively. Multifactorially adjusted and smoking behavior-adjusted subhazard ratios for homozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2) for lungcancer, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0 to 3.0) for bladder cancer, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.0) forischemic heart disease, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4) for ischemic stroke.

RESULTS: Multifactorially adjusted and genotype-adjusted subhazard ratios for a cumulative tobacco consumption above 40 pack-years versus 0 pack-years were 32.5 (95% CI, 12.0 to 87.7) for lung cancer, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.5) for bladder cancer, 9.4 (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.7) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3 to 1.8) for ischemic heart disease, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4) for ischemic stroke. Among smoking noncarriers and homozygotes, daily tobacco consumption was 16 and 18 g/d (P < .001), cumulative tobacco consumption was 28 and 31 pack-years (P = .003), and smoking inhalation was 71.9% and 78.1% (P < .001), respectively. Multifactorially adjusted and smoking behavior-adjusted subhazard ratios for homozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2) for lungcancer, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0 to 3.0) for bladder cancer, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.0) forischemic heart disease, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4) for ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Although smoking is associated with major tobacco-related diseases in the general population, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism is associated with additional increased risk of lung cancer, bladdercancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after adjustment for smoking.","OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism (rs1051730) on chromosome 15q25 marking thegene cluster CHRNA3-CHRNB4-CHRNA5, smoking behavior, and tobacco-related cancer and lung and cardiovascular diseases in the general population.",(rs1051730),tobacco-related cancer,neutral,zero

"Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The TCF7L2 gene is located on chromosome 10q25 in a region of replicated linkage to type 2 diabetes. Recently, a microsatellite marker in intron 3 DG10S478 and five correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in Icelandic individuals that showed strong association with type 2 diabetes, which was replicated in Danish and European-American cohorts.  We genotyped four of the SNPs (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) in Amish subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 137), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 139), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 342).  We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with type 2 diabetes with those with NGT and found marginal association for rs7901695 (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51);  comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined type 2 diabetes/IGT case group showed </ModMar>strong</ModMar> association with rs7901695 and rs7903146 (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with rs11196205 and rs12255372 (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively). In an expanded set of 698 Amish subjects without diabetes, we found no association with insulin and glucose levels during a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test.

"BACKGROUND: Common polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been associated with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether the two most strongly associated variants (rs12255372 and rs7903146) predict the progression to diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance who were enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which lifestyle intervention or treatment with metformin was compared with placebo. METHODS: We genotyped these variants in 3548 participants and performed Cox regression analysis using genotype, intervention, and their interactions as predictors. We assessed the effect of genotype on measures of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at baseline and at one year. RESULTS:  Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at rs7903146 were more likely to have progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001). The effect of genotype was stronger in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.70; P=0.004) than in the metformin and lifestyle-intervention groups (hazard ratios, 1.62 and 1.15, respectively; P for the interaction between genotype and intervention not significant).

In the meta-analysis, Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated with random-effect model or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity analysis. The quality of included studies was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The sensitivity analysis was used to confirm the reliability and stability of the meta-analysis. In total, 20 case-control studies with 9122 cases of T2DM and 8017 controls were included.

"BACKGROUND: Variation in the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster is a promising candidate region for smoking behavior and has been linked to multiple smoking-related phenotypes (e.g., nicotine dependence) and diseases (e.g., lung cancer). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs16969968 in CHRNA5 and rs1051730 in CHRNA3, have generated particular interest.

"OBJECTIVE: New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) is a frequent and serious complication arising after liver transplantation (LT). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms have been reported to strongly associate with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the donor liver plays a vital role in regulating bloodglucose levels. In this study, we aim at evaluating the association between donor and recipient TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with NODM after LT. METHODS: A total of 125 patients undergoing primary LT, without a history of diabetes were included.  Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs290487, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372), closely associated with type 2 diabetes in the Eastern Asia population, were genotyped and analyzed.  RESULTS: Both donor and recipient rs290487 polymorphisms (CC vs. TT genotype) were found to be significantly associated with NODM. In multivariate analysis, donor rs290487 genetic variation (OR = 2.172 per each C allele, p = 0.015), blood tacrolimus levels at 1 month post-LT >10 ng/ml (OR = 3.264, p = 0.017), and recipient age >55 years (OR = 2.638, p = 0.043) were identified as independent risk factors of NODM. Furthermore, donor rs290487 CCgenotype could predict a high probability (>40%) of the onset of NODM. Predictive model containing donor rs290487 polymorphism showed a significantly higher prognostic ability on NODM than the model with only clinical parameters (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Donor TCF7L2 rs290487 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of NODM after LT and has a potential clinical value for the prediction of NODM.",CONCLUSIONS: Donor TCF7L2 rs290487 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of NODM after LT and has a potential clinical value for the prediction of NODM.,rs290487,NODM,positive,strong
"This paper addresses a tenet of the literature on APOE, i.e., the relationship between the effects of the ε4, one of the established genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its expression levels as determined by APOE promoter polymorphisms.

Consistent with previous studies, all three SNPs showed a strong association with susceptibility to T2DM, both at genotypic (P = 0.003, P = 0.004 and P = 0.012) and at allelic level (P = 0.0004, P = 0.0004 and P = 0.003). Moreover, we observed associations between TCF7L2 variants and the following diabetic complications: diabetic retinopathy,cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease. We also found a strong correlation between the rs7903146 and the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (P = 0.02 with a high OR = 8.28).

"OBJECTIVE: Variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in adults, but the association of TCF7L2 with weight-related traits and body fat in humans is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the TCF7L2 gene(rs12255372) and obese phenotype in Mexican school-age children. METHODS: The study was performed in schools in Mexico City; 186 obese and 194 control children were studied. Fasting insulin and glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides concentration were determined. The variantrs12255372 of the TCF7L2 gene was genotyped. We used age- and sex-adjusted linear models to test for association with metabolic measurements with this variant. RESULTS: Genotype of the TCF7L2 rs12255372 gene was associated with lower fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001) and lower homeostasismodel assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p = 0.001) in nonobese children. Heterozygous carriers for this variant were more prevalent in leanchildren (32.5%) than in the obese group (23.7%), which resulted in a strong protective effect for the normal weight condition (OR = 0.56, 0.32-0.97).

"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the association of 31 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-beta cell function (HOMA-β), HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and type 2 diabetes in the Indian population. METHODS: We genotyped 3,089 sib pairs recruited in the Indian Migration Study from four cities in India (Lucknow, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Bangalore) for 31 SNPs in 24 genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes in European populations. We conducted within-sib-pair analysis for type 2 diabetes and its related quantitative traits. RESULTS: The risk-allele frequencies of all the SNPs were comparable with those reported in western populations. We demonstrated significant associations of CXCR4 (rs932206), CDKAL1 (rs7756992) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs12255372) with fasting glucose, with β values of 0.007 (p = 0.05), 0.01 (p = 0.01), 0.007 (p = 0.05), 0.01 (p = 0.003) and 0.08 (p = 0.01), respectively. Variants in NOTCH2 (rs10923931), TCF-2 (also known as HNF1B) (rs757210), ADAM30 (rs2641348) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661) significantly predicted fasting insulin, with β values of -0.06 (p = 0.04), 0.05 (p = 0.05), -0.08 (p = 0.01) and -0.08 (p = 0.02), respectively. For HOMA-IR, we detected associations with TCF-2, ADAM30 and CDKN2A/B, with β values of 0.05 (p = 0.04), -0.07 (p = 0.03) and -0.08 (p = 0.02), respectively. We also found significant associations of ADAM30 (β = -0.05; p = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (β = -0.05; p = 0.03) with HOMA-β. THADA variant (rs7578597) was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.04, 2.22; p = 0.03).

"New onset posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has a high incidence after kidney transplantation in patients medicated with tacrolimus. PTDM can adversely affect patient and graft survival.

"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (ε2/ε3/ε4: rs429358 ε4 allele; rs7412 ε2 allele) is strongly associated with both lipid levels and Alzheimer's disease. Although there is also evidence of milder cognitive impairment in later life in carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, there have been few studies investigating the impact of APOE genotype on cognitive function in children.

RESULTS: Observed genotype group counts were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ(2)p value = .84). There were strong relationships between APOE genotype and low-density lipoproteincholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, which follow the same patterns as in adults.

Expression of assays ""ex12-13"", ""ex12-14"" and ""ex13-13a"" detecting C-terminal alternative exons of TCF7L2 was higher in subcutaneous compared to omental adipose tissue by 1.46 fold (p = 6.5x10(-15)), 1.41 fold(p = 1.4x10(-9)) and 1.26 fold (p = 4.7x10(-6)) in the control group and by 1.86 fold (p = 1.7x10(-4)), 1.77 fold (p = 7.3x10(-4)) and 1.58 fold (p = 6.1x10(-4)) in the T2D group. A pathway enrichment analysis on transcripts significantly co-expressed with TCF7L2 in a microarray set combined with individual expression assays, suggested tissue-specific roles of TCF7L2 splicing forms in regulation of transcription, signal transduction and cell adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of TCF7L2 alternatively spliced forms may have different functional roles in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue but is not associated with SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 or T2D status.",BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymiorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146 and rs12255372 located within TCF7L2 gene have been identified as the strongest common genetic risk factors for development of type 2 diabetes(T2D).,rs12255372,type 2 diabetes,positive,moderate
"BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 is a transcription factor involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling which has a variant known to be associated with risk of Type 2 diabetes and, in some studies, with risk of certain cancers, including familial breast cancer. No studies of ovarian cancer have been reported to date. METHODS: Two clinic-based case-control studies at the Mayo Clinic were assessed including 798 breast cancer cases, 843 breast cancer controls, 391 ovarian cancer cases, and 458 ovarian cancer controls. Genotyping at TCF7L2 rs12255372 used a 5' endonuclease assay, and statistical analysis used logistic regression among participants as a whole and among a priori-defined subsets. RESULTS: No associations with risk of breast or ovarian cancer were observed (ordinal model, p = 0.62 and p = 0.75, respectively). In addition, no associations were observed among sub-groups defined by age, BMI, family history, stage, grade, histology, or tumor behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Although the biology of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and prior association between rs12255372 and numerous phenotypes warranted examination of this TCF7L2 SNP, no compelling evidence for association with breast or ovarian cancer was observed.","CONCLUSIONS: Although the biology of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and prior association between rs12255372 and numerous phenotypes warranted examination of this TCF7L2 SNP, no compelling evidence for association with breast or ovarian cancer was observed.",rs12255372,ovarian cancer,negative,-
"Premature adrenarche (PA) has been associated with increased body mass index. Our aim was to determine whether the obesity-associated variant at fat mass and obesity gene (FTO) is more frequent in PA subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that altered Wnt signaling due to genetic variants at transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) could play a role in the polygenic pathogenesis of PA. We genotyped polymorphisms at FTO rs9939609 and atTCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs12255372 in 73 Finnish white prepubertal children with PA and in 97 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the associations of these genetic variations with weight, height, circulating adrenocortical hormone levels, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and blood pressure. The differences in the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of rs9939609, rs7903146, and rs12255372 were not statistically significant between the PA and control groups (difference in MAFs [95% confidence interval]: -0.06 [-0.18, 0.05], 0.04 [-0.05, 0.12], and 0.01 [-0.07, 0.10]; P = .3, .4, and .8, respectively). However, the risk allele at TCF7L2 rs7903146 was more frequent in PA subjects than in controls when we restricted the analysis to the subjects with lower weight-for-height than the median of the PA subjects (weight-for-height <108%, corresponding body mass index SD score <0.79; difference in MAFs [95% confidence interval]: 0.12 [-0.001, 0.23]; P = .038).

"BACKGROUND: Two types of cerumen occur in humans: the wet type with brownish, sticky earwax, and the dry type with a lack of or reduced ceruminous secretion. The wet type is common in populations of European and African origin, while the dry type is frequently seen in Eastern Asian populations. An association between axillary odor and the wet-type earwax was first identified approximately 70 years ago. The data were based on a phenotypical analysis of the two phenotypes among the Japanese by a researcher or by self-declaration of the subjects examined, and were not obtained using definite diagnostic methods. Recently, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs17822931) of the ABCC11 gene as the determinant of the earwax types. In the present study, to determine whether the SNP can serve as a diagnostic marker for axillary osmidrosis (AO), we examined genotypes at rs17822931 in 79 Japanese AO individuals. AO was defined here as a clinical condition of individuals with a deep anxiety regarding axillary odor and had undergone the removal of bilateral axillary apocrine glands. RESULTS: A comparison of the frequencies of genotypes at rs17822931 in the 79 AO individuals and in 161 Japanese from the general population showed that AO was strongly associated with the wet earwax genotype. A total of 78 (98.7%) of 79 AO patients had either the GG or GA genotype, while these genotypes were observed in 35.4% (57/161) of the subjects from the general population (p < 1.1 x 10(-24), by Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between the wet-earwax associated ABCC11-genotypes (GG and GA) and AO identified in this study indicates that the genotypes are good markers for the diagnosis of AO. In addition, these results suggest that having the allele G is a prerequisite for the axillary odor expression. In other words, the ABCC11 protein may play a role in the excretory function of the axillaryapocrine gland. Together, these results suggest that when an AO individual visiting a hospital is diagnosed with dry-type earwax by ABCC11-genotyping, surgical removal of their axillary glands may not be indicated.","In the present study, to determine whether the SNP can serve as a diagnostic marker for axillary osmidrosis (AO), we examined genotypes at rs17822931 in 79 Japanese AO individuals.",rs17822931,axillary osmidrosis,neutral,zero

"We have previously demonstrated that haplotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the first intron of the OCA2 gene are extremely strongly associated with variation in human eye color.

"We have previously demonstrated that haplotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the first intron of the OCA2 gene are extremely strongly associated with variation in human eye color.

"Background: Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) polymorphisms are proposed to be important factors in the presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in many disorders, including decreased striatum levels of dopamine D2 receptors in Wilson disease. The present study investigated the association between DRD2 gene polymorphisms and clinical manifestation of Wilson disease. Methods: Analyzing data from 97 symptomatic Wilson disease patients, we investigated the DRD2 gene polymorphisms rs1800497, rs1799732, and rs12364283. We assessed the polymorphisms impact on the phenotypicpresentation of the disease. Results: Generally, the DRD2 gene polymorphisms had no impact on the hepatic or neuropsychiatric clinical presentation of Wilson disease. However, rs1799732 deletion allele carriers with neuropsychiatric symptoms had earlier onset of WD symptoms by almost 6 years compared with individuals without this allele (22.5 vs. 28.3 years; P < 0.05). This unfavorable effect of the rs1799732 polymorphism was even more pronounced among adenosine triphosphatase 7B gene (ATP7B) p.H1069Q homozygous patients, in whom carriership of the deletion allele was related to earlier initial neuropsychiatric manifestation by 14 years (18.4 vs. 32.2 years; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Genetic variation of DRD2, specifically the rs1799732 polymorphism, may produce an earlier clinical presentation of Wilson disease neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs that occur in the course of <Phent id=1>dopaminergic system impairment<Phent> due to copper accumulation in the brain. We speculate that this effect may be due to the impact of DRD2 polymorphism on dopamine D2 receptor density, but further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of such phenotypic effects.","Conclusions: Genetic variation of DRD2, specifically the rs1799732 polymorphism, may produce an earlier clinical presentation of Wilson disease neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs that occur in the course of <Phent id=1>dopaminergic system impairment<Phent> due to copper accumulation in the brain.",rs1799732,Wilson,positive,weak

"Although the advent of atypical, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) has resulted in reduced likelihood of akathisia, this adverse effect remains a problem. It is known that extrapyramidal adverse effects are associated with increased drug occupancy of the dopamine 2 receptors (DRD2).

Definite akathisia (a score ≥ 2 in the global clinical assessment of akathisia) was significantly less common in subjects who were prescribed SGAs (16.8%) than those prescribed FGAs (47.6%), p < 0.0001. Overall, 24.1% of A1+ patients (A1A2/A1A1) who were treated with SGAs hadakathisia, compared to 10.8% of A1- (thus, A2A2) patients. A1+ patients who were administered SGAs also had higher global clinical assessment of akathisia scores than the A1- subjects (p = 0.01). SGAs maintained their advantage over FGAs regarding akathisia, even in A1+ patients who were treated with SGAs. These results strongly suggested that A1+ variants of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A allele do confer an associated risk for akathisia inpatients who were treated with SGAs, and these variants may explain inconsistencies found across prior studies, when comparing FGAs and SGAs.","These results strongly suggested that A1+ variants of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A allele do confer an associated risk for akathisia inpatients who were treated with SGAs, and these variants may explain inconsistencies found across prior studies, when comparing FGAs and SGAs.",DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A,akathisia,positive,moderate

"BACKGROUND: The prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) gene encodes a membrane protein that acts on angiotensin II (Ang II) and kallikrein to release vasoactive peptides. The chymase (CMA1) gene is important for Ang II generation. Therefore, the two genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: Eleven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRCP gene and four tag SNPs and G-1903A (rs1800875) polymorphism in the CMA1 gene were genotyped in the Chinese Han population (n=1020) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: In the PRCP gene, single site analyses indicated that the rs7104980 G allele was a susceptible factor for EH (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.43, p=0.3×10(-10)).

In the case of the CMA1 gene, no associations with EH were found through single site analyses. However, haplotype analyses showed that Hap16 TTTA significantly increased the risk of EH with OR=3.15 (p=0.0002) which may be driven by interaction with a nearby SNP combination.

"BACKGROUND: Atopic disorders are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Associations analyses between thepromoter polymorphism rs1800875 in the mast cell chymase gene (CMA1) and atopy-related phenotypes have yielded inconsistent results. METHODS: We sequenced the CMA1 locus in 24 unrelated healthy individuals with serum IgE levels <50% percentile and 24 individuals with atopic eczema andserum IgE levels >90% percentile. Seven CMA1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated for evidence of associations with atopic phenotypes within a large population of German adults (n = 1875). Subjects were phenotyped by standardized questionnaires and interviews, skin pricktesting and serum IgE measurements. Genotyping was performed using MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry).

No associations between any other single SNP and atopic phenotypes could be detected. Haplotype reconstruction revealed four of 128 possible haplotypes reaching estimated frequencies of 3% or more. Two of these haplotypes showed a borderline-significant association with atopic eczema, which did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing.

METHODS: We recruited 619 hypertensive case subjects and 2,458 individuals with normal blood pressure from the Beijing Child and Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome study, a population-based case-control study. We selected 6 SNPs from earlier GWASs of hypertension and genotyped them using TaqMan assay. RESULTS: In the normal weight group, we did not observe any significant association of 6 SNPs and the genetic risk score (GRS) with SBP/DBP and hypertension (all P > 0.05). Only STK39 rs3754777 was significantly associated with higher DBP (P = 0.02) in the overweight subjects.

"Alpha-actinin-3 (ACTN3) is an integral part of the Z line of the sarcomere. The ACTN3 R577X (rs1815739) polymorphism determines the presence or absence of functional ACTN3, which may influence the extent of exercise-induced muscle damage. This study aimed to compare the impact of, and recovery from, muscle-damaging eccentric exercise on subjects with or without functional ACTN3. Seventeen young men (20-33 years old), homozygous for the R (n = 9) or X (n = 8) alleles, performed two bouts of stretch-shortening exercise (50 drop jumps) two weeks apart. Muscle soreness, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, jump height, maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVC), peak concentric isokinetic torque (IT), and electrically stimulated knee extension torques at 20 and 100 Hz were measured at baseline and at a number of time points up to 14 days after each bout. There were no significant baseline differences between the groups. However, significant time point × genotype interactions were observed for MVC (p = 0.021) and IT (p = 0.011) for the immediate effect of eccentric exercise in bout 1. The RR group showed greater voluntary force decrements (RR vs. XX: MVC, -33.3% vs. -24.5%; IT, -35.9% vs. -23.2%) and slower recovery. A repeated-bout effect was clearly observed, but there were no differences by genotype group. The ACTN3 genotype modulates the response of muscle function to plyometric jumping exercise, although the differences are modest. The ACTN3 genotype does not influence the clearly observed repeated-bout effect; however, XX homozygotes recover baseline voluntary torque values faster and thus may be able to undertake more frequent training sessions.","The ACTN3 R577X (rs1815739) polymorphism determines the presence or absence of functional ACTN3, which may influence the extent of exercise-induced muscle damage.",rs1815739,muscle damage,positive,weak
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to hypoxia and has been associated with athletic performance. The aims of this study were (1) to determine the frequency distribution of HIF1A Pro582Ser (rs11549465) polymorphism among 155 Israeli athletes (sprinters and endurance athletes) and 240 healthy controls and (2) to analyze the influence of the interaction between HIF1A Pro582Ser and ACTN3 R577X (rs1815739) genotypes on sprint performance. There were no differences across the HIF1A genotype and allele frequencies among endurance athletes, sprinters, and controls. Similarly, no differences were found between the subgroups of top-level and national-level endurance athletes, or between top-level and national-level sprinters. Conversely, interaction effects were found between HIF1A Pro582Ser and ACTN3 R577X polymorphisms and sprinters. The proportion of HIF1A Pro/Pro + ACTN3 R/R genotypes was significantly higher in sprinters than in endurance athletes and healthy controls (P = .002). In addition, the odds ratio for HIF1A Pro/Pro + ACTN3 R/R genotype carriers being a sprinter was 2.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.1); and that for HIF1A Pro/Pro + ACTN3 R/R genotype carriers being an endurance athlete was 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.24). We conclude that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism by itself is not critical in determining sprint performance. However, sprinter performance is determined by the interaction between the wild-type HIF1A Pro/Pro genotype and ACTN3 RR genotype.",We conclude that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism by itself is not critical in determining sprint performance.,Pro582Ser,sprint performance,negative,-

"OBJECTIVE: The genetic susceptibility factors underlying sleep disorders might help us predict prognoses and responses to treatment. Several candidate polymorphisms for sleep disorders have been proposed, but there has as yet inadequate replication or validation that the candidates may be useful in the clinical setting. METHODS: To assess the validity of several candidate associations, we obtained saliva deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples and clinical information from 360 consenting research participants who were undergoing clinical polysomnograms. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were genotyped. These were thought to be related to depression, circadian sleep disorders, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), excessive sleepiness, or to slow waves in sleep. RESULTS: With multivariate generalized linear models, the association of TEF rs738499 with depressive symptoms was confirmed. Equivocal statistical evidence of association of rs1801260 (the C3111T SNP in the CLOCK gene) with morningness/eveningness and an association of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) rs429358 with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were obtained, but these associations were not strong enough to be of clinical value by themselves.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) oresophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressorgenes. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA (rs2273535), ERBB2 (rs1136201), MDM2 (rs2279744), CDH1 (rs5030625),CDKN2A (rs11515), and TP73 (rs2273953) genes were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients, who had underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Associations with disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients withEAC or ESCC. However, in a multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.45-0.88]).Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carryingthe wild-type genotype AHR 4.0, 95% CI [1.4-11]. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients, the MDM2 T/G and CDH1 GA/GAgenotype confer risk of death in patients with EAC.

"BACKGROUND: The investigation of rare familial forms of kidney cancer has provided important insights into the biology of sporadic renal cellcarcinoma (RCC). In particular, the identification of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) familial cancer syndrome gene (VHL) provided the basis for the discovery that VHL is somatically inactivated in most sporadic clear cell RCC. Many cases of familial RCC do not have mutations in known RCC susceptibility genesand there is evidence that genetic modifiers may influence the risk of RCC in VHL disease patients. Hence we hypothesised that low-penetrance functional genetic variants in pathways related to the VHL protein (pVHL) function might (a) modify the phenotypic expression of VHL disease and/or (b) predispose to sporadic RCC.

In the present study, we report two additional markers near the SREBF1 locus on chromosome 17p that were also significant after multiple testing correction (best P = 3.1 x 10(-6) for marker rs3183702). There was no convincing evidence of association for remaining genes, including candidates highlighted from recent genome-wide association studies of plasma lipids (CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1, MLXIPL, PCSK9, GALNT2 and GCKR).

"OBJECTIVE: Augmented susceptibility to infections increases mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD). We sought to determine the contribution of selected genetic variants involved in inflammatory signalling downstream of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to severe bacterial infections(SBIs) in patients with ESLD. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed incidence of SBIs in 336 adult ESLD patients enlisted for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and genotyped them for TLR4 c.+1196C/T, CD14 c.-159C/T, TNFA c.-238G/A, TNFA c.-863C/A, IL1B c.-31C/T and IL1RN variable number of tandem repeats allelic variants. Principal findings were validated in an independent cohort of 332 ESLD patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients from the identification cohort and 40% of patients from the validation cohort presented with SBI while enlisted for OLT. The presence of the variant allele TNFA c.-238A (rs361525) was associated with lower serum levels of TNF-α, and with significantly decreased risk of SBI in both cohorts. Multivariate analysis showed that the relative protection from SBI associated with this allele almost completely negated the increased susceptibility to SBI owed to advanced ESLD. Although not predictive of overall mortality, the presence of TNFA c.-238A allele was associated with a complete prevention of SBI-related pre-transplant deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genetic variability in inflammatory signalling is associated with the development of SBI in patients with ESLD. Specifically, we identified the importance of TNFA c.-238A allele as a strong predictor of protection from SBI, and as a genetic marker associated with significantly improved pre-transplant survival in patients with SBI.","The presence of the variant allele TNFA c.-238A (rs361525) was associated with lower serum levels of TNF-α, and with significantly decreased risk of SBI in both cohorts.",rs361525,SBI,positive,strong

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with 7-day point prevalenceabstinence (abstinence) in randomized clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies in individuals grouped by pharmacotherapy randomization to inform the development of personalized smoking cessation therapy. METHODS: We quantified association of four SNPs at three nAChRs with abstinence in eight randomized clinical trials. Participants were 2633 outpatient treatment-seeking, self-identified European ancestry individuals smoking at least 10 cigarettes/day, recruited through advertisement, prescribed pharmacotherapy, and provided with behavioral therapy. Interventions included nicotinereplacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, placebo (PLA), or combined NRT and bupropion, and five modes of group and individual behavioral therapy. Outcome measures tested in multivariate logistic regression were end of treatment and 6 month (6MO) abstinence, with demographic, behavioral, and genetic covariates. RESULTS: 'Risk' alleles previously associated with smoking heaviness  were significantly (P<0.05) associated with reduced abstinence in the PLA pharmacotherapy group (PG) at 6MO [for rs588765, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.41 (0.17-0.99)], and at end of treatment and at 6MO [for rs1051730, 0.42 (0.19-0.93) and 0.31 (0.12-0.80)], and with increased abstinence in the NRT PG at 6MO [for rs588765, 2.07 (1.11-3.87) and for rs1051730, 2.54 (1.29-4.99)].

"BACKGROUND: Evidence has suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α may be involved in the aetiology of psoriasis, but the underlying association of the TNF-α polymorphisms -238G/A (rs361525) and -308G/A (rs1800629) with the risk of psoriasis is still unconfirmed. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to determine whether the TNF-α -238G/A and -308G/A polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to psoriasis. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), CBM (Chinese biomedical literature database) and WANFANG databases within a range of published years from 1990 to August 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the different associations. RESULTS: In total, 17 studies with 2847 cases and 2222 controls were found for -238G/A and 20 studies with 2975 cases and 2243 controls for -308G/A. The pooled results showed an overall increased risk of psoriasis for the -238G/A polymorphism (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.45-2.94, P < 0.001 for AA/GA vs. GG) and a reduced psoriasis risk with the -308G/A polymorphism (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.79, P < 0.001 for AA/GA vs. GG). This association was only present in early-onset psoriasis (OR = 3.68, 95% CI = 2.17-6.24, P < 0.001 for -238G/A; OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.43-0.72, P < 0.001 for -308G/A), whereas there was no association (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.56-1.70, P = 0.92 for -238G/A) or a unreliable association (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.46-0.94, P = 0.02 for -308G/A) in late-onset psoriasis.

"BACKGROUND: Although more than 100 non-HLA variants have been tested for associations with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in candidate genestudies, only a few have been replicated. We sought to replicate reported associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PTPN22, TNFAand MIF genes in a well-characterized cohort of children with JIA. METHODS: We genotyped and analyzed 4 SNPs in 3 genes: PTPN22 C1858T (rs2476601), TNFA G-308A, G-238A (rs1800629, rs361525) and MIF G-173C (rs755622) in 647 JIA cases and 751 healthy controls. We tested for association between each variant and JIA as well as JIA subtypes. We adjusted for multiple testing using permutation procedures. We also performed a meta-analysis that combined our results with published results from JIA association studies. RESULTS: While the PTPN22 variant showed only modest association with JIA (OR = 1.29, p = 0.0309), it demonstrated a stronger association with the RF-positive polyarticular JIA subtype (OR = 2.12, p = 0.0041).

"BACKGROUND: Genotypes of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and its surface receptors, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B, have been examined in terms of the progression, metastasis, clinical efficacy, and prognosis of various cancers; however, little is known about their effects on clinical outcome inpatients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, TNF-α and TNFRSF1A genotypes were retrospectively evaluated in terms of predicting clinical response, long-term survival, and severe acute toxicities in 46 male Japanese ESCC patients treated with definitive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU at 400 mg/m(2)/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 and 8, and radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, with a second course being repeated after a 2-week interval. The TNF-α -1031T>C (rs1799964), -863C>A (rs1800630), -857C>T (rs1799724), -308G>A (rs1800629), -238G>A (rs361525), TNFRSF1A -609G>T (rs4149570), and 36A>G (rs767455) genotypes were evaluated. RESULTS: The TNF-α -857C>T genotype was found to be predictive of clinical response, i.e., complete response or not (P = 0.010, Fisher's exact test), but had no effect on long-term survival (CC(-857) vs. CT(-857) + TT(-857), P = 0.072, Fisher's exact test, P = 0.070, Log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-α -857C>T genotype was found to be predictive of clinical response and was more likely to predict long-term survival in Japanese ESCC patients receiving definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT.

"INTRODUCTION. Indians are more likely to develop alcoholic cirrhosis compared to Caucasians, though the cause remains obscure. North Indians tend to consume more alcohol than other parts of the country. Genetic factors are likely to play a major role in these observations. This study investigated whether 10 different polymorphisms were associated with alcohol dependence and/or cirrhosis in North Indians. These were in ADH2*2 (rs1229984),ADH3*2 (rs698), CYP2E1*1D, CYP2E1*5 (rs3813867 and rs2031920), TNF-α(rs1800629), TNF-α (rs361525), IL-1β (rs3087258), CD-14 (rs2569190), IL-10(rs1800872) and PNPLA3 (rs738409). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Hundred healthy controls and 120 chronic alcoholics (60 alcoholic noncirrhotics and 60 alcoholic cirrhotics) attending various departments of PGIMER, Chandigarh were genotyped using PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS.

"OBJECTIVE: Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer disease are known for individuals of European ancestry, but whether the same or different variants account for the genetic risk of Alzheimer disease in African American individuals is unknown. Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for genetic testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with late-onsetAlzheimer disease in African Americans. METHODS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in   ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was comparable with that of the APOE ϵ4-determining SNP rs429358 (allele = C; frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.19-2.42]; P = 5.5 × 10(-47)).

CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of data from African American participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly associated with variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been associated with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry.

"BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 is the strongest type 2 diabetes (T2D) locus identified to date, and evidence suggests it plays an important role in insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion. Dietary factors that increase the insulin demand might enhance the risk of T2D associated with TCF7L2 variants. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the risk of T2D associated with TCF7L2 is modified by the glycemic load (GL), glycemic index (GI), cereal fiber content, and total carbohydrate content of the diet. METHODS: T2D cases (n = 1140) and controls (n = 1915) from the Nurses' Health Study were genotyped for TCF7L2 (rs12255372). Dietary intake was assessed with a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Significant differences in odds ratios (ORs) of T2D associated with the TCF7L2 genotype between high and low strata of GL (P = 0.03) and GI (P = 0.05) were suggested. Compared with the GG genotype, multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of T2D associated with the TT genotype were 2.71 (1.64, 4.46) and 2.69 (1.64, 4.43) among individuals in the highest tertile of GL and GI, respectively. Corresponding ORs (95% CIs) among individuals in the lowest tertiles of GL and GI were 1.66 (0.95, 2.88) and 1.82 (1.11, 3.01). The risk of T2D associated with the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism did not significantly differ by cereal fiber or carbohydrate intake. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate quality and quantity modified risk of T2D associated with   TCF7L2, which suggests that changes in risk attributable to the TCF7L2 variant are magnified under conditions of increased insulin demand.","CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate quality and quantity modified risk of T2D associated with   TCF7L2, which suggests that changes in risk attributable to the TCF7L2 variant are magnified under conditions of increased insulin demand.",TCF7L2,T2D,positive,weak
"OBJECTIVE: Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes via impaired insulin secretion. One hypothesis is that variation in TCF7L2 impairs insulin processing in the beta cell. In contrast, the association of related TCF7L2 polymorphisms with obesity is controversial in that it has only been shown in cohorts susceptible to ascertainment bias. We reproduced the association of diabetes-associated variants with proinsulin/insulin ratios, and also examined the association of a TCF7L2 haplotype with obesity in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with obesity) in 2,512 FHS participants. We used age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed-effects models to test for association with glycaemic traits, proinsulin/insulin ratios and obesity measures. RESULTS: As expected, the T risk allele of rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.01). T/T homozygotes had a 23.5% increase in the proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 1 x 10(-7)) compared with C/C homozygotes. There was no association of HapA with BMI (p = 0.98), waist circumference (p = 0.89), subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 0.32) or visceral adipose tissue (p = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that the risk allele of rs7903146 is associated with hyperglycaemia and a higher proinsulin/insulin ratio. We did not detect any association of the TCF7L2 HapA with adiposity measures, suggesting that this may have been a spurious association from ascertainment bias, possibly induced by the evaluation of obesity in separate groups of glycaemic cases and controls.","METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with obesity) in 2,512 FHS participants.",rs7903146,type 2 diabetes,positive,weak

METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with obesity) in 2,512 FHS participants. We used age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed-effects models to test for association with glycaemic traits, proinsulin/insulin ratios and obesity measures. RESULTS: As expected, the T risk allele of rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.01). T/T homozygotes had a 23.5% increase in the proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 1 x 10(-7)) compared with C/C homozygotes.

"TCF7L2, HHEX and IDE on chromosome 10q23-25 reside within the linkage region for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies including ours have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms in these three loci are associated with T2D, respectively. But, it is unclear whether TCF7L2, independently or interactively with HHEX and IDE, confer the susceptibility to T2D. In the present study, we first replicated genetic association study of the TCF7L2 gene in a Swedish cohort including 528 non-diabetic healthy controls and 243 T2D patients and then evaluated combining effect from common risk polymorphisms in TCF7L2-HHEX-IDE loci. T2D patients were diagnosed in the intermediate study time. To avoid influence from anti-diabetic treatment, baseline data in all T2D patients were used for analysis. We found that SNPs rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were strongly associated with T2D (p<0.004).

"BACKGROUND: There is controversy as to whether type 2 diabetes genetic susceptibility contributes to type 1 diabetes, and it is not known what proportion of islet autoantibody-negative new onset subjects have type 2 diabetes risk alleles. OBJECTIVE: We designed this study to evaluate whether two type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with the development of islet autoantibody-negative diabetes vs. islet autoantibody-positive diabetes in young patients and whether these SNPs are associated with specific clinical phenotypes. METHODS: Autoantibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell antibody 512bdc (form of IA-2), insulin, ZnT8 transporter, and cytoplasmic islet cell antibody were assayed in patients with new onset diabetes seen at the Barbara Davis Center using sera obtained within 2 wk ofdiagnosis. We genotyped two noncoding variants in the TCF7L2 gene, rs12255372 and rs7903146, in diabetic subjects and normal controls. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients (15.7%) were negative for all islet autoantibodies among 893 subjects less than age 25 at the onset of diabetes. The allele and genotype frequencies of two SNP srs12255372 and rs7903146 showed that these are associated (odds ratio up to 4) with the development of diabetes in the autoantibody-negative diabetic cohort, but not in the autoantibody-positive diabetic cohort.

OBJECTIVE: We designed this study to evaluate whether two type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with the development of islet autoantibody-negative diabetes vs. islet autoantibody-positive diabetes in young patients and whether these SNPs are associated with specific clinical phenotypes. METHODS: Autoantibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell antibody 512bdc (form of IA-2), insulin, ZnT8 transporter, and cytoplasmic islet cell antibody were assayed in patients with new onset diabetes seen at the Barbara Davis Center using sera obtained within 2 wk ofdiagnosis. We genotyped two noncoding variants in the TCF7L2 gene, rs12255372 and rs7903146, in diabetic subjects and normal controls. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients (15.7%) were negative for all islet autoantibodies among 893 subjects less than age 25 at the onset of diabetes. The allele and genotype frequencies of two SNP srs12255372 and rs7903146 showed that these are associated (odds ratio up to 4) with the development of diabetes in the autoantibody-negative diabetic cohort, but not in the autoantibody-positive diabetic cohort.

"OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to confirm possible associations between candidate genes from genome-wide association studies and type 2 diabetes in Japanese diabetic patients and a community-based general population. A total of 11 previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, and KCNJ11 genes were analyzed. METHODS: Candidate SNPs were genotyped in 506 type 2 diabetic patients and 402 control subjects and meta-analyzed with six previous association studies in Japanese patients. Associations with fasting plasma insulin levels were investigated in a general population sample (n = 1,963, 61 +/- 13 years). RESULTS: In our case-control subjects, susceptibility to type 2 diabetes was replicated in TCF7L2 rs12255372, CDKAL1 rs7756992, rs7754840, HHEX (rs7923837), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and SLC30A8 (rs13266634). In addition to these polymorphisms, meta-analysis confirmed the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility with KCNJ11 rs5219, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and HHEX rs1111875. The TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism showed the highest odds ratio (OR) for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.714 [1.298-2.263]). Odds ratio of other polymorphisms ranged from 1.13 to 1.41. The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors.

METHODS: Candidate SNPs were genotyped in 506 type 2 diabetic patients and 402 control subjects and meta-analyzed with six previous association studies in Japanese patients. Associations with fasting plasma insulin levels were investigated in a general population sample (n = 1,963, 61 +/- 13 years). RESULTS: In our case-control subjects, susceptibility to type 2 diabetes was replicated in TCF7L2 rs12255372, CDKAL1 rs7756992, rs7754840, HHEX (rs7923837), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and SLC30A8 (rs13266634). In addition to these polymorphisms, meta-analysis confirmed the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility with KCNJ11 rs5219, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and HHEX rs1111875. The TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism showed the highest odds ratio (OR) for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.714 [1.298-2.263]). Odds ratio of other polymorphisms ranged from 1.13 to 1.41. The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes susceptibility of seven candidate genes was confirmed in Japanese. Conservation of susceptible loci for type 2 diabetes was independent of ethnic background.",The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors.,rs7756992,lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic,positive,strong

We studied a randomly selected group of 869 individuals with self-reported diabetes or non-fasting serum glucose >or=11.1 mmol/L and 2,080 non-diabetic control subjects with non-fasting serum glucose <5.5 mmol/L. Four candidate polymorphisms in the three genes TCF7L2 (rs12255372 and rs7903146), PPARG (rs1801282), KCNJ11 (rs5219) and traditional risk factors were studied. RESULTS: Risk alleles of the TCF7L2 gene showed increased risk of diabetes even when controlled for traditional diabetes risk factors (diabetes in family, waist circumference, physical activity, BMI, SBP and total and HDL-cholesterol) in both a cross-sectional and prospective setting (cross-sectional: rs12255372 OR 1.61 (1.31-1.99), rs7903146 OR 1.48 (1.20-1.83) and prospective: rs12255372 OR 1.59 (1.22-2.07), rs7903146 OR 1.47 (1.11-1.93)). The risk alleles of TCF7L2 indicated impaired beta-cell function in patients and control subjects. The population attributable risks for diabetes with TCF7L2 risk alleles were 15 % and with diabetes in a first-degree relative 31 %. CONCLUSIONS: The risk alleles of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 and rs7903146) were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, even after controlling for traditional risk factors in both a cross-sectional and prospective setting.

"UNLABELLED: We studied the impact of genetic and traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes in a large, population-based study from Nord-Trøndelag county in Norway (HUNT), in both cross-sectional and prospective design.

"OBJECTIVE: The gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been related to type 2 diabetes in multiple ethnic groups. Here, we investigate whether three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with an impaired proinsulin:insulin ratio. METHODS: In this study we examined the associations between SNPs rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene and metabolic variables affecting type 2 diabetes in a population-based study of 706 unrelated individuals (47% men and 53% women; aged 35-74 years) from the province of Segovia in central Spain (Castille), including 180 individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with that in non-diabetic individuals. The T (minor) allele of the variant rs7903146 was significantly associated with a greater OR for type 2 diabetes adjusted for age, sex and BMI in logistic regression analysis: OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.06-1.57, p = 0.01). This risk allele was also associated with an increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after OGTT. Similar results were obtained for the other TCF7L2 SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further evidence supporting the belief that the TCF7L2 gene is a major determinant of type 2 diabetes risk in Spain, as in other southern European populations. The association with increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after an OGTT suggests that TCF7L2 might be involved in insulin synthesis and processing.","RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with that in non-diabetic individuals.",rs7901695,diabetic,positive,strong

"BACKGROUND: Tropical calcific pancreatitis (TCP) is a type of chronic pancreatitis unique to developing countries in tropical regions and one of its important features is invariable progression to diabetes, a condition called fibro-calculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD), but the nature of diabetes in TCP is controversial. We analysed the recently reported type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene using a case-control approach, under the hypothesis that TCF7L2 variants should show similar association if diabetes in FCPD is similar to T2D. We also investigated the interaction between the TCF7L2 variants and N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations, since they are strong predictors of risk for TCP. METHODS: Two polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing in 478 well-characterized TCP patients and 661 healthy controls of Dravidian and Indo-European ethnicities. Their association with TCP with diabetes (FCPD) and without diabetes was tested in both populations independently using chi-square test. Finally, a meta analysis was performed on all the cases and controls for assessing the overall significance irrespective of ethnicity. We dichotomized the whole cohort based on the presence or absence of N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations and further subdivided them into TCP and FCPD patients and compared the distribution of TCF7L2 variants between them. RESULTS: The allelic and genotypic frequencies for both TCF7L2 polymorphisms, did not differ significantly between TCP patients and controls belonging to either of the ethnic groups or taken together. No statistically significant association of the SNPs was observed with TCP or FCPD or between carriers and non-carriers of N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations.

"BACKGROUND: The rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants of TCF7L2 have been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in most populations studied to date. Meta-analysis of 27 different studies has resulted in a global OR of 1.46 [1.42-1.51] (rs7903146 variant). Thus far, despite a high incidence of T2D, the role of this variant in Arabs has not been established. METHODS: We performed a case-control association study using 522 Saudi T2D patients (WHO criteria), and 346 controls (age > 60; fasting plasma glucose < 7 mmol/L). Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: For rs7903146, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.415) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.405). The crude odds ratio (OR) was 1.04 with a 95% CI of 0.86-1.27 (P = 0.675). For rs12255372, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.368) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.355).

"BACKGROUND: The rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants of TCF7L2 have been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in most populations studied to date. Meta-analysis of 27 different studies has resulted in a global OR of 1.46 [1.42-1.51] (rs7903146 variant). Thus far, despite a high incidence of T2D, the role of this variant in Arabs has not been established. METHODS: We performed a case-control association study using 522 Saudi T2D patients (WHO criteria), and 346 controls (age > 60; fasting plasma glucose < 7 mmol/L). Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: For rs7903146, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.415) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.405). The crude odds ratio (OR) was 1.04 with a 95% CI of 0.86-1.27 (P = 0.675). For rs12255372, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.368) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.355).

"OBJECTIVE: Recently, variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been found to be consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in different populations. In this study, we hypothesized that TCF7L2 also contributed to genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. METHODS: We looked for new variants by direct sequencing of all exons and intron-exon junctions of TCF7L2 in 100 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, and then we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by Snapshot technology in 1,000 Chinese individuals. RESULTS: By sequencing, we identified six SNPs (c.1,637C>A; c.1,674C>G; c.1,709G>A; c.1,846C>G; c.1,888C>T; and c.1,876T>G), and three of them led to non-synonymous polymorphisms (c.1,637C>A, His-->Gln or Pro-->Thr; c.1,674C>G, Pro-->Arg; and c.1,709G>A, Ala-->Thr).

"BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a high mobility group-box containing protein that is a critical member of the Wnt/beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway. In addition to its recently recognized role in diabetes, aberrant TCF7L2 expression has been implicated in cancer through regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by c-MYC and cyclin D. It has been hypothesized that germline variants within the TCF7L2 gene previously associated with diabetes may affect cancer risk through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Specifically, the same risk allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 that is associated with diabetes (T allele) has recently been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. METHODS: Here, we investigated associations between rs12255372 and prostate cancer risk among 1,457 cases and 1,351 controls from a population-based study. RESULTS: The variant TT genotype was not associated with overall prostate cancer risk. However, there was evidence that men homozygous for the variant T allele had an elevated relative risk of more aggressive prostate cancer, as defined by high Gleason score (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8) or regional/distant stage (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.6) disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that this variant in the TCF7L2 gene may be associated with risk of developing more clinically significant disease.

"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have implicated variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in several different populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether variants of this gene are also risk factors for type 2 diabetes development in a UK-resident South Asian cohort of Punjabi ancestry. METHODS: We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2 (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372) in 831 subjects with diabetes and 437 control subjects. RESULTS: The minor allele of each variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes; the greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11 - 1.56, p = 1.96 x 10(-3)). For each variant, disease risk associated with homozygosity for the minor allele was greater than that for heterozygotes, with the exception of rs12255372. To determine the effect on the observed associations of including young control subjects in our data set, we reanalysed the data using subsets of the control group defined by different minimum age thresholds. Increasing the minimum age of our control subjects resulted in a corresponding increase in OR for all variants of the gene (p < or= 1.04 x 10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support recent findings that TCF7L2 is an important genetic risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes in multiple ethnic groups.","RESULTS: The minor allele of each variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes; the greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11 - 1.56, p = 1.96 x 10(-3)).",rs7903146,type 2 diabetes,positive,moderate

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to assess beta cell function (HOMA2-%B) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). The SNP genotypes were analyzed against disease stage [normal glucose=0 (n=188), pre-diabetes=1 (n=85), and DM=2 (n=95)] and against clinical and biochemical measures. Age and sex were included as covariates in all association analyses. Additional adjustments were made for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in several analyses. RESULTS: Diabetes disease stage was marginally significantly associated with the frequency of the T variant at rs12255372 (p=0.057; adjusted p=0.017) but not at rs7903146 (p=0.5; adjusted p=0.2).Comparison between subjects with normal glucose and the combined DM/pre-diabetes showed a significant association with rs12255372 (OR 1.47, CI 1.04-2.08; p=0.03) but not with rs7903146 (OR 1.16, CI 0.81-1.64; p=0.4).

"OBJECTIVE: Common DNA variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL) is characterised by hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, or both. Additionally, disturbances in glucose metabolism are commonly seen in FCHL. Therefore, we hypothesised that TCF7L2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for this common dyslipidaemia. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 variants, rs7903146 and rs12255372, on FCHL and its component traits triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in 759 individuals from 55 Mexican families. As a replication sample, 719 individuals from 60 Finnish FCHL families were analysed. We also used quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of TCF7L2 in 47 subcutaneous fat biopsies from unrelated Mexican FCHL and normolipidaemic participants. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican FCHL families,No evidence for association was observed for FCHL, TC, ApoB or glucose in Mexicans. When testing rs7903146 and rs12255372 for replication in Finnish FCHL families, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TG (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007). Furthermore, we observed statistically significant decreases in the mRNA levels (p = 0.0002) of TCF7L2 in FCHL- and TG-affected individuals. TCF7L2 expression was not altered by the SNP genotypes.

"OBJECTIVE: Common DNA variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL) is characterised by hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, or both. Additionally, disturbances in glucose metabolism are commonly seen in FCHL. Therefore, we hypothesised that TCF7L2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for this common dyslipidaemia. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 variants, rs7903146 and rs12255372, on FCHL and its component traits triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in 759 individuals from 55 Mexican families. As a replication sample, 719 individuals from 60 Finnish FCHL families were analysed. We also used quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of TCF7L2 in 47 subcutaneous fat biopsies from unrelated Mexican FCHL and normolipidaemic participants. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican FCHL families,No evidence for association was observed for FCHL, TC, ApoB or glucose in Mexicans.

"OBJECTIVE: Common DNA variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL) is characterised by hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, or both. Additionally, disturbances in glucose metabolism are commonly seen in FCHL. Therefore, we hypothesised that TCF7L2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for this common dyslipidaemia. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 variants, rs7903146 and rs12255372, on FCHL and its component traits triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in 759 individuals from 55 Mexican families. As a replication sample, 719 individuals from 60 Finnish FCHL families were analysed. We also used quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of TCF7L2 in 47 subcutaneous fat biopsies from unrelated Mexican FCHL and normolipidaemic participants. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican FCHL families,No evidence for association was observed for FCHL, TC, ApoB or glucose in Mexicans. When testing rs7903146 and rs12255372 for replication in Finnish FCHL families, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TG (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007). Furthermore, we observed statistically significant decreases in the mRNA levels (p = 0.0002) of TCF7L2 in FCHL- and TG-affected individuals. TCF7L2 expression was not altered by the SNP genotypes.

"OBJECTIVE: Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a major complication associated with kidney transplantation. Defects in insulin secretionplay a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PTDM. A polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes and possibly associated with an insulin secretion defect. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in TCF7L2 and PTDM in renal allograft recipients. METHODS: A total of 511 unrelated renal allograft recipients without previously known diabetes were enrolled. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11196205, rs4506565, rs12243326, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs7901695) were genotyped in the cohort, which consisted of 119 PTDM patients and 392 non-PTDM subjects. The genotyping of TCF7L2 polymorphisms was performed using real-timePCR. RESULTS:rs4506565,rs7901695, and rs7903146 were found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium. The rs7903146 genotype distribution was CC 94.3% and CT 5.7%. The incidence of PTDM was significantly higher in patients with the CT genotype than in patients with the CC genotype (41.4 vs. 22.2%) (odds ratio 2.474 [95% CI 1.146-5.341]; P = 0.024). The effect of this genotype remains significant after adjustment for age, sex, amount of bodyweight gain, and type of immunosuppressant (2.655 [1.168-6.038]; P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic variation is associated with an increased risk of PTDM in renal allograft recipients.",CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic variation is associated with an increased risk of PTDM in renal allograft recipients.,rs7903146,PTDM in renal allograft recipients,positive,weak
"OBJECTIVE: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was initially reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and U.S. populations. We investigated whether TCF7L2 also has a role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility in Pima Indians. METHODS: The six variants reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in the Icelandic study were genotyped in a population-based sample of 3,501 Pima Indians (1,561 subjects had type 2 diabetes, and 1,940 did not have diabetes). In addition, the coding and promoter regions of TCF7L2 were sequenced in 24 Pima subjects. The one variant identified by sequencing, 35 additional database variants positioned in introns, and the six variants reported in the Icelandic study were genotyped in Pima families to determine the haplotype structure of TCF7L2 among Pima Indians. Fourteen representative variants were selected and genotyped in 3,501 Pima Indians. RESULTS: The six variants initially reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes were less common in Pima Indians compared with samples of European origin, and none were associated with type 2 diabetes. One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07). However, several variants were associated with BMI; in particular, rs12255372 was associated in both general and within-family analyses (both P = 0.0007). Modest associations were also found with traits predictive for type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Variation within TCF7L2 does not confer major risk for type 2 diabetes among the Pima Indian population.","One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07).",rs1225404,type 2 diabetes,positive,weak

"OBJECTIVE: Common variants of the gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have a powerful effect on individual risk of type 2 diabetes (per allele odds ratio approximately 1.35). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes are familial conditions sharing common features. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to establish whether variation in TCF7L2 also influences the development of PCOS. METHODS: We conducted a genetic association study of variants of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372) using both case-control and quantitative trait approaches. Case-control analyses were conducted in (1) 369 PCOS cases and 2574 controls of UK British/Irish origin, and (2) 540 women with PCOS symptoms and 1083 controls from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966. Quantitative trait analyses (androgen levels) were also performed (1249 individuals). RESULTS: There was no association between rs7903146 and PCOS in the UK case-control study (Cochran-Armitage test, p = 0.51); nor with symptomatic status in the Finnish cohort (p = 0.36). In addition, there were no relationships between the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 and androgen levels (UK cases, p = 0.99; Finnish controls, p = 0.57; Finnish symptomatic cases, p = 0.80).

"Genetic variants in the gene encoding for transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and impaired beta cell function, but the mechanisms have remained unknown. We therefore studied prospectively the ability of common variants in TCF7L2 to predict future T2D and explored the mechanisms by which they would do this. Scandinavian subjects followed for up to 22 years were genotyped for 3 SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs10885406) in TCF7L2, and a subset of them underwent extensive metabolic studies. Expression of TCF7L2 was related to genotype and metabolic parameters in human islets. The CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs7903146 strongly predicted future T2D in 2 independent cohorts (Swedish and Finnish). The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in T2D, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype. Overexpression of TCF7L2 in human islets reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In conclusion, the increased risk of T2D conferred by variants in TCF7L2 involves the enteroinsular axis, enhanced expression of the gene in islets, and impaired insulin secretion.",The CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs7903146 strongly predicted future T2D in 2 independent cohorts (Swedish and Finnish).,rs7903146,T2D,positive,strong
"Common variants of TCF7L2, encoding a beta-cell-expressed transcription factor, are strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined this association using both prospective and case-control designs. A total of 2,676 healthy European white middle-aged men from the prospective NPHSII (158 developed T2D over 15 years surveillance) were genotyped for two intronic SNPs [rs 7903146 (IVS3C>T) and rs12255372 (IVS4G>T)] which showed strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.88, p<0.001; R(2)=0.76, p<0.001). The IVS5T allele frequency was 0.28 (95% CI 0.27-0.29) and 0.33 (0.28-0.39) in healthy and T2D, respectively (p=0.04). Compared to CC men, CT and TT men had an adjusted [for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and C-reactive protein levels] hazard ratio for T2D of 1.65 (1.13-2.41) and 1.87 (0.99-3.53), respectively, p<0.01. The population attributable fraction for diabetes risk was 17%. In 1459, European white T2D men and women (60% male), T allele frequency was 0.36 (0.34-0.38), and compared to NPHSII healthy men the OR for T2D for the CT and TT subjects was 1.43 (1.24-1.65) and 2.11 (1.69-2.63), respectively p=<0.0001. A similar effect was observed in 919 T2D Indian Asians [OR=1.50 (1.14-1.99) and 1.64 (1.03-2.63) p=0.003] and 385 Afro-Caribbean subjects [OR=1.25 (0.90-1.75) and 1.32 (0.74-2.33) p=0.17] compared to non-diabetic ethnically matched subjects from South London. Weaker associations were found for the IVS4G>T in all studies. Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was high in Indian Asians (D'=0.94), but much weaker in Afro-Caribbeans (D'=0.17) and haplotype frequencies differed markedly in this group. These results extend previous observations to other ethnic groups, and strongly confirm that   TCF7L2 genotype is a major risk factor for development of T2D.","These results extend previous observations to other ethnic groups, and strongly confirm that   TCF7L2 genotype is a major risk factor for development of T2D.",TCF7L2,T2D,positive,strong
"OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with type 2 diabetes and reduced insulin secretion. The transcription factor TCF7L2 is an essential factor for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from intestinal L cells. We studied whether a defect in the enteroinsular axis contributes to impaired insulin secretion in carriers of TCF7L2 polymorphisms. METHODS: We genotyped 1,110 non-diabetic German participants for five single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2. All participants underwent an OGTT; GLP-1 secretion was measured in 155 participants. In 210 participants, an IVGTT combined with a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp was performed. In another 160 participants from the Netherlands and 73 from Germany, a hyperglycaemic clamp (10 mmol/l) was performed. In 73 German participants this clamp was combined with a GLP-1 infusion and an arginine bolus. RESULTS: The OGTT data confirmed that variants in TCF7L2 are associated with reduced insulin secretion. In contrast, insulin secretion induced by an i.v. glucose challenge in the IVGTT and hyperglycaemic clamp was not different between the genotypes. GLP-1 concentrations during the OGTT were not influenced by the TCF7L2 variants. However, GLP-1-infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele in two variants ( rs7903146 , rs12255372 , p < 0.02),. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of TCF7L2 specifically impair GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. This seems to be rather the result of a functional defect in the GLP-1 signalling in beta cells than a reduction in GLP-1 secretion. This defect might explain the impaired insulin secretion in carriers of the risk alleles and confers the increased risk of type 2 diabetes.","However, GLP-1-infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele in two variants ( rs7903146 , rs12255372 , p < 0.02),.","rs7903146 ,",GLP-1-induced insulin secretion,positive,strong

"OBJECTIVE: The genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is being analyzed in multiple whole genome association studies (WGAS). The GAB2 gene has been proposed as a modifying factor of APOE epsilon 4 allele in a recent case-control WGAS conducted in the US. Given the potential application of these novel results in AD diagnostics, we decided to make an independent replication to examine the GAB2 gene effect in our series. METHODS: We are conducting a multicenter population-based study of AD in Spain. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 1116 Spanish individuals. Specifically, 521 ADpatients, 475 controls from the general population and 120 neurologically-normal elderly controls (NNE controls). METHODS: We have genotyped GAB2 (rs2373115 G/T) and APOE rs429358 (SNP112)/rs7412 (SNP158) polymorphisms using real time-PCR technologies. RESULTS: As previously reported in Spain, APOE epsilon 4 allele was strongly associated with AD in our series (OR=2.88 [95% C.I. 2.16- 3.84], p=7.38E-11). Moreover, a large effect for epsilone 4/epsilone 4 genotype was also observed (OR=14.45 [95% C.I., 3.34-125.2], p=1.8E-6). No difference between the general population and the NNE controls series were observed for APOE genotypes (P > 0.61). Next, we explored GAB2 rs2373115 SNP singlelocus association using differentgenetic models and comparing AD versus controls or NNE controls. No evidence of association with AD was observed for this GAB2 marker (p > 0.17). To evaluate GAB2-APOE genegene interactions, we stratified our series according to APOE genotype and case-control status, in accordance with the original studies. Again, no evidence of genetic association with AD was observed in any strata of GAB2-APOE loci pair (p > 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: GAB2 rs2373115 marker does not modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish APOE epsilon 4 carriers.","RESULTS: As previously reported in Spain, APOE epsilon 4 allele was strongly associated with AD in our series (OR=2.88 [95% C.I.",APOE epsilon 4,AD,positive,strong
"OBJECTIVE: In a population-based cohort of elderly men with well-defined phenotypes and biochemical markers related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we analysed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7903146 and rs12255372, in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The 1,142 subjects were from the population-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort study (see http://www.pubcare.uu.se/ULSAM/, last accessed in May 2007). Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp; fasting intact and 32-33 split proinsulin, immunoreactive insulin and specific insulin were measured in plasma samples. The SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 were genotyped using a fluorescent homogeneous single base extension assay. The SNP genotypes were analysed against diabetes prevalence at age 70 using logistic regression and against quantitative biochemical measures using linear regression analysis.

"OBJECTIVE: There is considerable interindividual variation in sulfonylurea response in type 2 diabetes. Transcription factor 7-like 2(TCF7L2) variants have been identified to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes risk, probably due to decreased beta-cell function. We hypothesized that variation in TCF7L2 would influence response to sulfonylureas but not metformin. We studied the effect of TCF7L2  rs12255372 and   rs7903146  genotypes on glycemic response. METHODS: The DARTS/MEMO (Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside/Medicines Monitoring Unit) collaboration database includes prescribing, biochemistry, and clinical phenotype of all patients with diabetes within Tayside, Scotland, from 1992. Of these, the TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 4,469 patients with type 2 diabetes recruited to GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside) between 1997 and July 2006. A total of 901 incident sulfonylurea users and 945 metformin users were identified. A logistic regression was used with treatment failure defined as an A1C >7% within 3-12 months after treatment initiation. Covariates included the TCF7L2 genotype, BMI, sex, age diagnosed, drug adherence, and drug dose. A1C pretreatment was available in a subset of patients (sulfonylurea n = 579; metformin n = 755). RESULTS: Carriers of the risk allele were less likely to respond to sulfonylureas with an odds ratio (OR) for failure of 1.95 (95% CI 1.23-3.06; P = 0.005), comparing rs12255372 T/T vs. G/G. Including the baseline A1C strengthened this association (OR 2.16 [95% CI 1.21-3.86], P = 0.009). A similar, although slightly weaker, association was seen with rs7903146. No association was seen between metformin response and either single nucleotide polymorphism, after adjustment for baseline A1C.

"OBJECTIVE: There is considerable interindividual variation in sulfonylurea response in type 2 diabetes. Transcription factor 7-like 2(TCF7L2) variants have been identified to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes risk, probably due to decreased beta-cell function. We hypothesized that variation in TCF7L2 would influence response to sulfonylureas but not metformin. We studied the effect of TCF7L2  rs12255372 and   rs7903146  genotypes on glycemic response. METHODS: The DARTS/MEMO (Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside/Medicines Monitoring Unit) collaboration database includes prescribing, biochemistry, and clinical phenotype of all patients with diabetes within Tayside, Scotland, from 1992. Of these, the TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 4,469 patients with type 2 diabetes recruited to GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside) between 1997 and July 2006. A total of 901 incident sulfonylurea users and 945 metformin users were identified. A logistic regression was used with treatment failure defined as an A1C >7% within 3-12 months after treatment initiation. Covariates included the TCF7L2 genotype, BMI, sex, age diagnosed, drug adherence, and drug dose. A1C pretreatment was available in a subset of patients (sulfonylurea n = 579; metformin n = 755).

"Polymorphisms within the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in several recent studies. We characterized three of these polymorphisms (rs12255372, rs7903146 and the microsatellite DG10S478) in an admixed sample of 286 patients with T2D and 275 controls from Mexico City. We also analyzed three samples representative of the relevant parental populations: Native Americans from the state of Guerrero (Mexico), Spanish from Valencia and Nigerians (Bini from the Edo region). In order to minimize potential confounding because of the presence of population stratification in the sample, we evaluated the association of the three TCF7L2 polymorphisms with T2D by using the program admixmap to fit a logistic regression model incorporating individual ancestry, sex, age, body mass index and education.

"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene with: (1) incident diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS, Study I); (2) type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (i.e. IGT or IFG) in a cross-sectional study (Study II); and (3) insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue expression of TCF7L2 in offspring of type 2 diabetic probands (III). METHODS: Study I (the DPS) included 507 individuals with IGT who were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups and followed for an average of 3.9 years to monitor for progression to diabetes. Study II was a population-based cross-sectional study of 1,766 men, aged 50-70 years, randomly selected from the population of Kuopio, eastern Finland. Study III included 238 non-diabetic offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes. Genotyping of rs12255372 and rs7903146 of TCF7L2 was carried out. RESULTS: In the DPS, the TT genotype of rs12255372 was significantly associated with an adjusted 2.85-fold risk (95% CI 1.17-6.95, p = 0.021) of incident diabetes in the control group, but not in the intervention group. In Study II, the adjusted odds ratio in subjects with the TT genotype was 3.40 (1.45-7.97, p = 0.005) for the comparison of diabetic subjects with normoglycaemic subjects. The T allele of rs12255372 was significantly associated with decreased insulin secretion (Studies II, III).

"OBJECTIVE: The gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been identified as a type 2 diabetes locus from genome-wide linkage studies and subsequent association analysis. We investigated the role of two common variants in TCF7L2 in a large case-control study recruited from the Tayside region of Scotland, UK. METHODS: We genotyped 6,516 participants for rs12255372 and  rs7903146 and analysed the role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility using binary logistic regression. Age, sex and obesity status were examined as covariates. The distribution of the genotypes within different treatment groups of cases was examined. RESULTS: Both variants were associated with type 2 diabetes (p < 10(-13)). The variants were present at very similar frequencies and were in strong linkage disequilibrium (R(2) = 0.88, D' = 0.89). A gene dosage effect of the rare allele of both variants was observed, the heterozygote CT group of rs7903146 having an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 1.2-1.5, p=1.54 x 10(-7)) for type 2 diabetes and the TT homozygote having a greater risk (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, p=1.40 x 10(-12)). An interaction with sex was observed, the males displaying a higher degree of genotype-associated risk compared with the females (p = 0.023). The T allele was associated with increased HbA(1c) levels in both cases and controls, and with decreased BMI and waist circumference in case but not controls. The T allele was overrepresented in individuals requiring insulin treatment and underrepresented in the patients being managed by diet alone (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed TCF7L2 to be a diabetes locus in a large case-control study in Tayside, UK.

"OBJECTIVE: Variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related quantitative traits. We examined variation in a 0.1-Mb region surrounding marker DG10S478 for association with diabetes-related quantitative traits in 132 Mexican-American families of a proband with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Study participants were phenotyped by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an intravenous glucose tolerance test and by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for percentage of body fat. Of the 42 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped, 15 were identified. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, none of the SNPs showed association with diabetes-related quantitative traits. However, rs12255372 showed association with 30' Deltainsulin (OGTT 30' min fasting insulin) in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.027). The effect of adiposity to increase 30' Deltainsulin was greater in subjects with the T allele. This interaction was not associated with acute insulin response to intravenous glucose. rs12255372 also showed an association with beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance based on 30' Deltainsulin in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.014).  rs12255372 was also associated with GDM (odds ratio [OR] 2.49 [95% CI 1.17-5.31]; P = 0.018) in our case-control sample.

"TCF7L2 acts as both a repressor and transactivator of genes, as directed by the Wnt signaling pathway. Recently, several highly correlated sequence variants located within a haplotype block of the TCF7L2 gene were observed to associate with type 2 diabetes in three Caucasian cohorts. We previously reported linkage of type 2 diabetes in the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFADS) cohort consisting of extended pedigrees of Mexican Americans to the region of chromosome 10q harboring TCF7L2. We therefore genotyped 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from nine haplotype blocks across the gene in 545 SAFADS subjects (178 diabetic) to investigate their role in diabetes pathogenesis.

"Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is part of the Wnt signaling pathway. Genetic variants within TCF7L2 on chromosome 10q were recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and American (U.S.) samples. We previously observed a modest logarithm of odds score of 0.61 on chromosome 10q, approximately 1 Mb from TCF7L2, in the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics study. We tested the five associated TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in a Finnish sample of 1,151 type 2 diabetic patients and 953 control subjects. We confirmed the association with the same risk allele (P value <0.05) for all five SNPs. Our strongest results were for rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.36 [95% CI 1.15-1.61], P = 0.00026) and rs7903146 (1.33 [1.14-1.56], P = 0.00042).

"BACKGROUND: Preoperative pain, type of operation and anesthesia, severity of acute postoperative pain, and psychosocial factors have been identified as risk factors for chronic postsurgical pain (CPP). Recently, it has been suggested that genetic factors also contribute to CPP. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and opioid receptor μ-1 (OPRM1) common functional polymorphisms rs4680 and rs1799971 were associated with the incidence, intensity, or duration of CPP in patients after lower abdominal surgery. METHODS: One hundred and two patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I/II underwent either abdominal radical prostatectomy (n = 45) or hysterectomy (n = 57). The incidences of CPP in the pelvic and scar areas were evaluated in all patients three months after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-five (34.3%) patients experienced CPP after lower abdominal surgery. Within this group, six (17.1%) patients demonstrated symptoms of neuropathic pain. For COMT rs4680, 22 (21.6%) patients had Met158Met, 55 (53.9%) patients had Val158Met, and 25 (24.5%) patients had Val158Val. No association was found between CPP phenotypes (incidence, intensity, and duration) and different rs4680 genotypes. For OPRM1 rs1799971, only CPP patients carrying at least one copy of the G allele had higher pain intensity than A118A carriers (p=0.02). No associations with other phenotypes were found.

"The catechol-O-methyltranferase (COMT) is one of the main enzymes that metabolise dopamine in the brain. The Val158Met polymorphism in the COMT gene (rs4680) causes a trimodal distribution of high (Val/Val), intermediate (Val/Met) and low (Met/Met) enzyme activity. We tested whether the Val158Met polymorphism is a modifier of the age at onset (AAO) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The rs4680 was genotyped in a total of 16 609 subjects from five independent cohorts of European and North American origin (5886 patients with PD and 10 723 healthy controls). The multivariate analysis for comparing PD and control groups was based on a stepwise logistic regression, with gender, age and cohort origin included in the initial model. The multivariate analysis of the AAO was a mixed linear model, with COMT genotype and gender considered as fixed effects and cohort and cohort-gender interaction as random effects. COMT genotype was coded as a quantitative variable, assuming a codominant genetic effect. The distribution of the COMT polymorphism was not significantly different in patients and controls (p=0.22). The Val allele had a significant effect on the AAO with a younger AAO in patients with the Val/Val (57.1±13.9, p=0.03) than the Val/Met (57.4±13.9) and the Met/Met genotypes (58.3±13.5). The difference was greater in men (1.9 years between Val/Val and Met/Met, p=0.007) than in women (0.2 years, p=0.81). Thus, the Val158Met COMT polymorphism is not associated with PD in the Caucasian population but acts as a modifier of the AAO in PD with a sexual dimorphism: the Val allele is associated with a younger AAO in men with idiopathic PD.","Thus, the Val158Met COMT polymorphism is not associated with PD in the Caucasian population but acts as a modifier of the AAO in PD with a sexual dimorphism: the Val allele is associated with a younger AAO in men with idiopathic PD.",Val158Met COMT,PD,negative,-

"OBJECTIVE: Disordered metabolism of estrogen is believed to play a significant role in endometrial carcinogenesis. Recently, a number of studies have been conducted to identify the role of estrogen-related gene polymorphism in endometrial cancer risk, generating conflicting conclusions. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between genetic polymorphisms involving estrogen metabolic enzymes and endometrial cancer risk. METHODS: A systematic search of 6 databases was conducted. Fourteen studies on the association of COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) Val158Met, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, and CYP1B1 Asn453Ser polymorphisms with endometrial cancer risk were identified, enrolling a total of 4283 cancer cases and 7094 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the relationship.

"BACKGROUND: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex as well as in the mesolimbic reward system. Since the reward system mediates addictive behavior, the COMT gene is a strong candidate gene regarding the pathophysiology of tobacco dependence and smoking behavior. Because of rather conflicting results in previous studies, the purpose of the present study was to test for association between a functional genetic variant in the COMT gene (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs4680) and tobacco smoking behavior. METHODS: In a population-based case-control multicenter study designed for tobacco addiction research, a total of 551 current smokers of European ancestry and 548 age-matched healthy volunteers (never-smokers) were genotyped for SNP rs4680 and extensively characterized concerning their smoking behavior. RESULTS: We found no association between smoking status and SNP rs4680 genotype nor did we find a significant association to the degree of tobacco dependence.

"OBJECTIVE: A strong association between susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and common variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), encoding an enteroendocrine transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis, has been reported in three different populations (Iceland, Denmark and USA) by Grant et al. We aimed to replicate these findings in a Dutch cohort. METHODS: We analysed the genotypes of two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 gene in 502 unrelated type 2 diabetes patients and in a set of healthy controls (n = 920). The two SNPs showed almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.91). RESULTS: We were able to replicate the previously reported association in our Breda cohort. The minor alleles of both variants were significantly over-represented in cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, [Formula: see text] for rs12255372; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19-1.66, [Formula: see text] for rs7903146). In addition, TCF7L2 haplotypes were analysed for association with the disease. The analysis of haplotypes did not reveal any strong association beyond that expected from analysing individual SNPs. The TT haplotype carrying the minor alleles was more frequent among cases (OR 1.38, [Formula: see text]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. The population-attributable risk from this factor in the Dutch type 2 diabetes population is 10%.",CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes.,variants of the TCF7L2,type 2 diabetes,positive,strong
"BACKGROUND: Rumination is a multidimensional trait which is a proven risk factor in the vulnerability to depression. The aim to identify the main risk genes for depression in addition to the gene-environment interactions pointed to the importance of intermediate phenotypes, like rumination, to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of depression. Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene is extensively investigated in depression with contradictory results but its association with rumination, as an intermediate phenotype in depression, has not been investigated yet. METHODS: In our study, four tagging SNPs in the COMT gene (rs933271, rs740603, rs4680, rs4646316) were genotyped in a nonclinical Hungarian sample (n=939). We investigated the association between the COMT gene and rumination scores measured by the Ruminative Response Scale using haplotype trend regression. RESULTS: We found a significant association between COMT haplotypes and rumination scores (p=0.013) but no significant association was apparent between the functional Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) and rumination in any genetic model. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in the COMT gene exert complex effects on susceptibility to depression involving intermediate phenotypes, such as rumination and also impulsivity, as we previously demonstrated. Both rumination and impulsivity represent maladaptive cognitive styles that can lead to depressive state by influencing the response to negative life events and life stressors. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that in addition to other genes,   COMT also has a significant role in the development of depression, and demonstrate that analysing the complex phenotype associations of genes by haplotype tagging is a powerful method.","In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that in addition to other genes,   COMT also has a significant role in the development of depression, and demonstrate that analysing the complex phenotype associations of genes by haplotype tagging is a powerful method.",COMT,depression,positive,strong

Common non-coding variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in European populations. We investigated whether TCF7L2 variants are also associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Indian population. METHODS: We genotyped type 2 diabetes patients (n = 955) and ethnically matched control subjects (n = 399) by sequencing three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs4506565) in TCF7L2. RESULTS: We observed a strong association type 2 diabetes with all the polymorphisms, including rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.50 [95% CI = 1.24-1.82], p = 4.0 x 10(-5)), rs4506565 (OR 1.48 [95% CI = 1.24-1.77], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and rs7903146 (OR 1.46 [95% CI = 1.22-1.75], p = 3.0 x 10(-5)). All three variants showed increased relative risk when homozygous rather than heterozygous, with the strongest risk for rs12255372 (OR 2.28 [95% CI = 1.40-3.72] vs OR 1.43 [95% CI = 1.11-1.83]). We found no association of the TCF7L2 genotypes with age at diagnosis, BMI or WHR, but the risk genotype at rs12255372 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001), higher 2-h plasma glucose (p = 0.0002) and higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p = 0.012) in non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study in Indian subjects replicates the strong association of TCF7L2 variants with type 2 diabetes in other populations.

RESULTS: We observed a strong association type 2 diabetes with all the polymorphisms, including rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.50 [95% CI = 1.24-1.82], p = 4.0 x 10(-5)), rs4506565 (OR 1.48 [95% CI = 1.24-1.77], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and rs7903146 (OR 1.46 [95% CI = 1.22-1.75], p = 3.0 x 10(-5)). All three variants showed increased relative risk when homozygous rather than heterozygous, with the strongest risk for rs12255372 (OR 2.28 [95% CI = 1.40-3.72] vs OR 1.43 [95% CI = 1.11-1.83]). We found no association of the TCF7L2 genotypes with age at diagnosis, BMI or WHR, but the risk genotype at rs12255372 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001), higher 2-h plasma glucose (p = 0.0002) and higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p = 0.012) in non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study in Indian subjects replicates the strong association of TCF7L2 variants with type 2 diabetes in other populations. It also provides evidence that variations in TCF7L2 may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by influencing both insulin secretion and insulin resistance.

"BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and its involvement inendothelial cell dysfunction is well established. However, the role of Hcy and folate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at evaluating the relationships between Hcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels in the blood and cognitive status in PDpatients with the genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR (rs1801133: C>T-677C>T, rs1801131: A>C-1298A>C), COMT (rs4680: A>G-Val158Met, rs6269: A>G, rs4633: C>T, rs4818: C>G), or SLC19A1 (rs1051266: G>A-80G>A). METHODS: A total of 502 participants (248 with PD and 254 age-matched and sex-matched controls) were included in the study. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, Hoehn-Yahr staging, and the Schwab-England scale were used to assess motor abilities and activity during daily life. Complex psychological examination with a battery of tests was used to classify patientsinto groups with (PDD) and without (nPDD) dementia. Blood samples were examined for Hcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels, as well as polymorphisms in genes related to Hcy metabolism, such as COMT, MTHFR, and SLC19A1(RFC-1). RESULTS: The frequency of homozygous COMT rs4680G and rs4633C allele carriers was significantly decreased in PD patients in comparison with the controls (P=0.015; odds ratio=0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.90 and P=0.020; odds ratio=0.619; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.92, respectively). No significant differences in the distribution of MTHFR 677C>T, 1298A>C, and SLC19A1 80G>A alleles and genotypes between PD patients and the controls were found. Hcy levels were significantly increased in PDpatients (18±7.8 μmol/l) as compared with the controls (14.0±9.6 μmol/l, P=10(-8)) and were significantly associated with the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism both in PD patients and controls, in which T allele carriers were characterized by markedly elevated Hcy plasma concentrations.  No association was observed between Hcy plasma level and COMT and SLC19A polymorphisms. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysisrevealed age (P=0.0003) and Hcy plasma levels (P=0.07) as independent risk factors predisposing individuals to PD dementia. The studied polymorphisms were not associated with cognitive status in PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic factors studied were not associated with cognitive status in PD patients. Only age and Hcy plasma levels were found to be independent risk factors predisposing individuals to PD dementia. However,COMT: rs4680: A>G and rs4633: C>T polymorphisms were found to significantly affect PD risk, and the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism helped determine plasma Hcy concentrations.","However,COMT: rs4680: A>G and rs4633: C>T polymorphisms were found to significantly affect PD risk, and the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism helped determine plasma Hcy concentrations.",COMT: rs4680: A>G and rs4633: C>T,PD,positive,strong

OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at evaluating the relationships between Hcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels in the blood and cognitive status in PDpatients with the genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR (rs1801133: C>T-677C>T, rs1801131: A>C-1298A>C), COMT (rs4680: A>G-Val158Met, rs6269: A>G, rs4633: C>T, rs4818: C>G), or SLC19A1 (rs1051266: G>A-80G>A). METHODS: A total of 502 participants (248 with PD and 254 age-matched and sex-matched controls) were included in the study. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, Hoehn-Yahr staging, and the Schwab-England scale were used to assess motor abilities and activity during daily life. Complex psychological examination with a battery of tests was used to classify patientsinto groups with (PDD) and without (nPDD) dementia. Blood samples were examined for Hcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels, as well as polymorphisms in genes related to Hcy metabolism, such as COMT, MTHFR, and SLC19A1(RFC-1). RESULTS: The frequency of homozygous COMT rs4680G and rs4633C allele carriers was significantly decreased in PD patients in comparison with the controls (P=0.015; odds ratio=0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.90 and P=0.020; odds ratio=0.619; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.92, respectively). No significant differences in the distribution of MTHFR 677C>T, 1298A>C, and SLC19A1 80G>A alleles and genotypes between PD patients and the controls were found. Hcy levels were significantly increased in PDpatients (18±7.8 μmol/l) as compared with the controls (14.0±9.6 μmol/l, P=10(-8)) and were significantly associated with the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism both in PD patients and controls, in which T allele carriers were characterized by markedly elevated Hcy plasma concentrations.

"OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerotic disease is a major health problem among the elderly, which arises from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes an enzyme that degrades catecholamines and estrogens to less activemetabolites. The objective of this study was to examine whether polymorphisms of the COMT gene affected the severity of atherosclerotic disease in aJapanese elderly population. METHODS: A total of 1536 autopsy cases of hospital deaths were assessed for the degree of pathological atherosclerotic index (PAI), coronary stenotic index (CSI) and intracranial stenotic index (ICAI), which were obtained by macroscopic examination of the luminal surface of formalin-fixed arteries. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COMT gene, rs4633 (C/T) and rs4680 (G/A) were genotyped. The rs4680 (G/A) corresponds to a functional SNP with the substitution of valine to methionine.RESULTS: The CC genotype of rs4633 (C/T) and the GG genotype of rs4680(G/A) showed a significantly higher degree of PAI and the association remained positive after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and drinking (p=0.035 and p=0.031, respectively).

"BACKGROUND: The Met158 allele of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene is associated with increased levels of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex and may increase the likelihood of aggressiveness. We conducted a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that the Met158 allele of the COMT gene is associated with aggressive and violent behavior in schizophrenia. METHODS: MEDLINE search (12/31/11) yielded 14 studies examining the association of the COMT gene polymorphism (rs4680) and aggression in schizophrenia (total n=2219). Three separate analyses were conducted using a random effects model for Met allele carriers vs. Val/Val homozygotes, Met/Met homozygotes vs. Val allele carriers, and Met allele vs. Val allele, respectively. Primary outcome was frequency of patients with aggressive behavior and odds ratio (OR) was the effect size measure. RESULTS: The frequency of violent patients in the sample ranged from 20% to 75%. The pooled effect sizes for the Met homozygotes vs. Val allele carriers, Met allele carriers vs. Val homozygotes and the Met allele vs. Val allele comparisons were 1.74, 1.65 and 1.35, ps<.05, respectively, suggesting that the Met 158 allele of the COMT gene is associated with higher risk for violence in schizophrenia.

"Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer which are two closely related diseases.

"Recently, significant associations between common variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene ( TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes have been reported.

"BACKGROUND: Common polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been associated with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether the two most strongly associated variants (rs12255372 and rs7903146) predict the progression to diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance who were enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which lifestyle intervention or treatment with metformin was compared with placebo. METHODS: We genotyped these variants in 3548 participants and performed Cox regression analysis using genotype, intervention, and their interactions as predictors. We assessed the effect of genotype on measures of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at baseline and at one year. RESULTS:Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at rs7903146 were more likely to have progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001).

"Cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for COPD and COPD severity. In turn COPD is a major independent risk factor for lung cancer. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies both in lung cancer and COPD highlighted the same variants (SNPs) on chromosome 15q25 marking the genecluster CHRNA3-CHRNB4-CHRNA5 for these smoking related diseases, showing a stimulating connection between this common genetic region and smoking behavior and smoking related illnesses.

"BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) form an essential part of the innate immune system, which plays a fundamental role in rapidly and effectively controlling infections and initiating adaptive immunity. There are no published data concerning the importance of polymorphisms of TLRs in conditioningsusceptibility to influenza or the severity of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether selected polymorphisms of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 influence the incidence and clinical picture of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza. RESULTS: The study involved 272 healthy children attending ourEmergency Room for influenza-like illness (ILI), including 51 (18.8%) with pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza as revealed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 164 healthy controls examined after minor surgery. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were studied: TLR2 rs5743708, TLR3 rs5743313, TLR3 rs5743315, TLR4 rs4986790 and TLR4 rs4986791.

METHODS: Overall, 150 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites were genotyped for TLR2 gene variants -16934 (rs4696480), Arg753Gln (rs5743708), Pro631His (rs5743704) and the TLR2GT microsatellite polymorphism in intron 2. Patients were monitored for SBP over two years. TLR2 SNPs were identified by hybridization probe assays on a LightCycler system.

"Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight. Common variation at rs1051730 is robustly associated with smoking quantity and was recently shown to influence smoking cessation during pregnancy, but its influence on birth weight is not clear. We aimed to investigate the association between this variant and birth weight of term, singleton offspring in a well-powered meta-analysis. We stratified 26 241 European origin study participants by smoking status (women who smoked during pregnancy versus women who did not smoke during pregnancy) and, in each stratum, analysed the association between maternal rs1051730 genotype and offspring birth weight. There was evidence of interaction between genotype and smoking (P = 0.007). In women who smoked during pregnancy, each additional smoking-related T-allele was associated with a 20 g [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4-36 g] lower birth weight (P = 0.014). However, in women who did not smoke during pregnancy, the effect size estimate was 5 g per T-allele (95% CI: -4 to 14 g; P = 0.268). To conclude, smoking status during pregnancy modifies the association between maternal rs1051730 genotype and offspring birth weight. This strengthens the evidence that smoking during pregnancy is causally related to lower offspring birth weight and suggests that population interventions that effectively reduce smoking in pregnant women would result in a reduced prevalence of low birth weight.","Common variation at rs1051730 is robustly associated with smoking quantity and was recently shown to influence smoking cessation during pregnancy, but its influence on birth weight is not clear.",rs1051730,smoking cessation,positive,weak
"BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and REM sleep abnormalities. A genome-wide association study identified a novel narcolepsy-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs5770917, which is located adjacent to CPT1B(carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B). In this study, we analyzed the CPT1B expression level and measured the carnitine fractions in blood samples obtained from narcolepsy patients and control subjects to test the hypothesis that fatty acid β-oxidation is altered in narcolepsy. RESULTS: We measured CPT1BmRNA expression in white blood cells of 38 narcolepsy patients and 56 healthy control subjects. The serum carnitine fractions (total carnitine, freecarnitine, and acylcarnitine) were measured in the 38 narcolepsy patients and in 30 of 56 control subjects. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk allele (C) for SNP rs5770917 was significantly associated with decreased CPT1B mRNA expression (P = 1.0 × 10(-9)), and the CPT1B expression was higher in the narcolepsy patients than in the controls (P = 0.005). The acylcarnitine levels were abnormally low in 21% of the narcolepsypatients while those of all the controls were within the normal range. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the dichotomous variable for acylcarnitine (normal or abnormal) as an objective variable revealed that the diagnosis of narcolepsy but not CPT1B expression level and BMI was associated with abnormally low acylcarnitine levels (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that multiple factors are involved in the regulation of serumacylcarnitine levels. Abnormally low levels of acylcarnitine observed in narcolepsy suggest dysfunctional fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.","Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk allele (C) for SNP rs5770917 was significantly associated with decreased CPT1B mRNA expression (P = 1.0 × 10(-9)), and the CPT1B expression was higher in the narcolepsy patients than in the controls (P = 0.005).",rs5770917,narcolepsy,positive,strong

"OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition with a strong genetic etiology, is associated with excess cardiovascular disease (CVD).Dyslipidemia in RA may be driven by inflammation and genetic factors. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is important for the regulation of lipid levels and CVD risk and immune function in the general population.

"Androgenetic alopecia, or male pattern baldness, is a complex condition with a strong heritable component. In 2001, we published the first significant evidence of a genetic association between baldness and a synonymous coding SNP rs6152 in the androgen receptor gene, AR. Recently, this finding was replicated in three independent studies, confirming an important role for AR in the baldness phenotype. In one such replication study, it was claimed that the causative variant underlying the association was likely to be the polyglycine (GGN) repeat polymorphism, one of two apparently functional triplet repeat polymorphisms located in the exon 1 transactivating domain of the gene. Here, we extend our original association finding and present comprehensive evidence from approximately 1,200 fathers and sons drawn from 703 families of the Victorian Family Heart Study, a general population Caucasian cohort, that neither exon 1 triplet repeat polymorphism is causative in this condition. Seventy-eight percent of fathers (531/683) and 30% of sons (157/520) were affected to some degree with AGA. We utilised statistical methods appropriate for the categorical nature of the phenotype and familial structure of the cohort, and determined that whilst SNP rs6152 was strongly associated with baldness (P < 0.0001), the GGN triplet repeat was not (P = 0.13). In the absence of any other known common functional coding variants, we argue that the causative variant is likely to be in the non-coding region, and yet to be identified. The identification of functional non-coding variants surrounding AR may have significance not only for baldness, but also for the many other complex conditions that have thus far been linked to AR.","We utilised statistical methods appropriate for the categorical nature of the phenotype and familial structure of the cohort, and determined that whilst SNP rs6152 was strongly associated with baldness (P < 0.0001), the GGN triplet repeat was not (P = 0.13).",rs6152,baldness,positive,strong

"BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a critical component of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Aberrant TCF7L2 expression modifies Wnt signaling and mediates oncogenic effects through the upregulation of c-MYC and cyclin D. Genetic alterations in TCF7L2 may therefore affect cancer risk. Recently, TCF7L2 variants, including the microsatellite marker DG10S478 and the nearly perfectly linked SNP rs12233372, were identified to associate with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 rs12255372 variant on familial breast cancer (BC) risk by means of TaqMan allelic discrimination, analyzing BRCA1/2 mutation-negative index patients of 592 German BC families and 735 control individuals. RESULTS: The T allele of rs12255372 showed an association with borderline significance (OR = 1.19, 95% C.I. = 1.01-1.42, P = 0.04), and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend revealed an allele dose-dependent association of rs12255372 with BC risk (Ptrend = 0.04).

Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher for stroke patients having at least one 19W allelecompared to non-carriers. A significant difference was also found for LDL-cholesterol levels of stroke patients; higher in -1131C allele carriers compared to wild type patients.

This study will give an insight about the association of two selected candidate gene polymorphisms; paraoxonase1 (PON1) Q192R and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) -1131T>C were assessed in a cohort of South Indian patients having CAD with and without T2DM.  Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping of PON1 Q192R (rs662) and APOA5-1131T>C (rs662799) polymorphism was carried out in 520 individuals, including 250 CAD patients (160 with T2DM and 90 without T2DM), 150 T2DMpatients with no identified CAD, and 120 normal healthy sex- and age-matched individuals as controls. The PON1 192RR genotype and R allele frequencywere elevated in both CAD and T2DM patients when compared with controls; however, only CAD patients with T2DM showed a statistical significance (p=0.023; OR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.04-2.12) when compared with controls. The APOA5-1131CC genotype and C allele also showed a significant association between the CAD+T2DM patients when compared with CAD without T2DM and healthy controls (p=0.012; OR=1.71; 95% CI: 1.0-2.67). An additive interaction between the PON1 RR and APOA5 TC genotypes was identified between the T2DM and CAD patients (p=0.028 and 0.0382, respectively). PON1 and APOA5 polymorphisms may serve as biomarkers in the South Indian population to identify T2DM patients who are at risk of developing CAD.",PON1 and APOA5 polymorphisms may serve as biomarkers in the South Indian population to identify T2DM patients who are at risk of developing CAD.,APOA5,CAD,positive,weak
"Genome-wide association studies and integrative genomics approaches have demonstrated significant associations between chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 15q25 region that includes iron-responsive element bindingprotein 2 gene (IREB2) and CHRNA3/5 in non-Asian populations. We investigated whether IREB2 and CHRNA3/5 polymorphisms would be associated withCOPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. Eight SNPs (rs2568494, rs2656069, rs10851906, rs1964678, rs12593229, rs965604, rs13180, rs17483929) in IREB2 gene and four SNPs (rs16969968, rs1051730, rs938682, rs8034191) in or near CHRNA3/5 locus were genotyped in a case-control study (680 COPD patients and 687 controls). No significant associations were found between any of the SNPs andCOPD in either former-smokers or current-smokers. Two SNPs (rs2656069 and rs10851906) in IREB2 were associated with COPD (P=0.045 and 0.032, respectively) in non-smoker.

The SNP rs8034191 near CHRNA3/5 locus was significantly associated with pack-years of smoking inCOPD patients (P=0.033). We demonstrated IREB2 polymorphisms were associated with COPD in non-smoking subjects, and the effect of IREB2 gene on COPD may be independent from smoking and independent from CHRNA3/5 gene cluster.

"OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine often develop hypertriglyceridemia. The apolipoprotein A5 gene (APOA5), which affects VLDL production and lipolysis, has been implicated in the triglyceride (TG) metabolism. This study examined the association of common APOA5 genetic variants and TG levels in chronically institutionalized schizophrenic patients, on a stable dose of atypical antipsychotic (clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone. METHODS: The TG levels in 466 schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine (n = 182), olanzapine (n = 89) or risperidone (n = 195) were measured. Patients were genotyped for the three APOA5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs662799 (-1131T > C), rs651821 (3A > G) and rs2266788 (1891T > C). RESULTS: A gene × drug interaction with TG levels was observed. In single-marker-based analysis, the minor alleles of the two polymorphisms (-1131C and -3G) were observed to be associated with increased TGs in patients treated with risperidone, but not with clozapine or olanzapine. Haplotype analysis further revealed that carriers of the haplotype constructed with the three minor alleles had higher TG levels than those who did not carry this haplotype in patients taking risperidone (CGC((+/+)) vs. = 125.4 ± 59.1 vs. 82.2 ± 65.8, P = 0.015; CGC((-/+ )) vs. CGC((-/-)) = 113.7 ± 80.4 vs. 82.2 ± 65.8, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend and add new information to the existing data regarding the association between APOA5 and TG regulation during long-term atypical antipsychotic treatment.",CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend and add new information to the existing data regarding the association between APOA5 and TG regulation during long-term atypical antipsychotic treatment.,APOA5,antipsychotic,positive,weak

"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies support the role for a strong genetic component in the occurrence of early-onset myocardial infarction (MI), although the specific genetic variants responsible for familial clustering remain largely unknown. METHODS: The Italian study of early-onset MI is a nationwide case-control study involving 1864 case patients <45 years old who were hospitalized for a first MI, and age/sex/place of origin-matched controls (n = 1864). We investigated the association between early-onset MI, lipid levels and 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate genesADIPOQ, APOA5, ALOX5AP, CYBA, IL6, LPL, PECAM1, PLA2G2A and PLA2G7, chosen because of previously reported associations with CoronaryHeart Disease (CHD) or with CHD risk factors. RESULTS: Of all the SNPs investigated, APOA5-1131T>C [(rs662799), minor allele frequency 0.084 (95%confidence interval (CI) 0.07-0.09)] alone showed a statistically significant association with risk of early-onset MI (p = 6.7 × 10(-5)), after Bonferroni correction, with a per C allele odds ratio of 1.44 (95% CI 1.23-1.69). In controls, APOA5-1131T>C was significantly associated with raised plasmatriglyceride levels (p = 0.001), compared with non-carriers, the per C allele increase being 11.4% (95% CI 4-19%), equivalent to 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI 0.11-0.20 mmol/L). In cases, the association with early MI risk remained statistically significant after adjustment for triglycerides (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The APOA5-1131C allele, associated with higher fasting triglyceride levels, strongly affects the risk for early-onset MI, even after adjusting for triglycerides. This raises the possibility that APOA5-1131T>C may affect the risk of early MI over and above effects mediated by triglycerides.","CONCLUSIONS: The APOA5-1131C allele, associated with higher fasting triglyceride levels, strongly affects the risk for early-onset MI, even after adjusting for triglycerides.",APOA5-1131C,MI,positive,strong

METHODS: Wegenotyped five tagging SNPs in 1330 unrelated subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study cohort with follow-up after a median interval of 6·4 years; 1952 subjects from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-Cardiovascular Disease Subcohort were used to replicate the findings. The MetS was defined according to the consensus criteria proposed jointly by several organizations in 2009. RESULTS: The SNP rs662799(-1131T>C) was associated with the MetS (odds ratio = 1·47, P = 0·00082) and the number of its components present (regression coefficient = 0·204, P = 4·6 × 10(-5) ) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, drinking and education in Hong Kong subjects at baseline. Similar association of this SNP was found in Hong Kong subjects at follow-up (P = 0·010 and 0·00021, respectively) and in Guangzhou subjects (P = 0·0041 and 0·017, respectively). The association of rs662799 with the number of the MetS components was significant regardless of age, sex, obesity and alcohol drinking, but almost disappeared after further adjusting for plasma triglycerides. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the -1131T>C polymorphism in APOA5was associated with the MetS because of its strong effect on plasma triglycerides. This may partly explain the higher cardiovascular risk in people with this polymorphism.","The association of rs662799 with the number of the MetS components was significant regardless of age, sex, obesity and alcohol drinking, but almost disappeared after further adjusting for plasma triglycerides.",rs662799,MetS,positive,strong

We investigated whichSNPs in the APOA5 gene were associated with triglyceride levels in two independent Chinese populations. In all, 1375 subjects in the Hong KongCardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study were genotyped for five tagging SNPs chosen from HapMap.

Plasma triglyceride level was 36.1% higher in CC compared to TT genotype. This association was confirmed in Guangzhou subjects (β=0.159, P=1.3 × 10(-12)), and was significantly irrespective of sex, age group, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and alcohol drinking. The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for plasma triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/l associated with TC and CCgenotypes were, respectively, 1.81 (1.37-2.39) and 2.22 (1.44-3.43) in Hong Kong and 1.27 (1.05-1.54) and 1.97 (1.42-2.73) in Guangzhou. Haplotypeanalysis suggested the association was due to rs662799 only.

"Several polymorphisms in the ApoA5 gene emerged as important candidate genes in triglyceride metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between ApoA5 polymorphisms, plasma triglyceride concentrations and the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in three ethnic origins. Genotypes for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined in 659 older adults (mean age 71+/-7 years) who immigrated to Israel or whose ancestors originated from East Europe (Ashkenazi), North Africa, Asia (Sephardic) or Yemen (Yemenite). The minor alleles of the four commonSNPs (rs662799, rs651821, rs2072560 and rs2266788) are associated with an increase of 27-38% in triglyceride concentration among Ashkenazi and Yemenite Jews compared with the major alleles, but not among those of Sephardic origin. Conversely, among the Sephardic group, the presence of theminor allele in SNP rs3135506 compared with the major allele was associated with an increase of 34% in triglyceride concentration. The four SNPs were in significant linkage disequilibrium (D'=0.96-0.99), resulting in three haplotypes H1, H2 and H3, representing 98-99% of the population. Haplotype H2 was significantly associated with triglyceride concentration among Ashkenazi and Yemenite but not among Sephardic Jews. Conversely, haplotype H3 was associated with triglyceride concentration in Sephardic but not in Ashkenazi and Yemenite Jews. Ashkenazi carriers of H2 haplotype had a CVD odds ratio of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.05-4.58) compared with H1 (the most frequent), after adjustment for all other risk factors.

"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) functional haplotypes determined by rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs have been extensively studied and found to be one of the most consistent association in human longevity studies. However, the search for longevity-determining genes in human has largely neglected theoperation of genetic interactions. METHODS: APOE haplotypes have been determined for 1072 unrelated healthy individuals from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and accounting for the different survival between sexes. The epistasis between APOE haplotypes and Haptoglobin (HP) 1/2 polymorphism was tested according to three-way contingency table analysis by a log-linear model. RESULTS: APOE genotype and haplotype distributions differ significantly along the age classes (Genotype: p=0.014; Haplotype: p=0.005) with APOE*ε4 genotype status and haplotype displaying negative association (Genotype: O.R.=0.377, p=0.002, Haplotype: O.R.=0.447, p=0.005).

"BACKGROUND: Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCH) is the most common genetic dyslipidaemia associated with coronary artery disease. Singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster are associated with FCH in Caucasians and with elevatedtriglycerides (TG) in various ethnic groups. We examined these associations with FCH in Hong Kong Chinese. METHODS: Fifty-six Chinese FCH patientsand 176 unrelated controls were studied. Thirteen SNPs in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster were genotyped. RESULTS: Four alleles in APOA5 were associated with FCH (P<0.001). The -1131T>C (rs662799) and -3A>G (rs651821) SNPs in APOA5 were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (LD, r(2)=0.99), and their minor alleles were more frequent (P<0.001) in FCH than controls (0.60 vs. 0.24). The odds ratio (OR) for FCH was 6.2 (95% CI, 2.6-14.8) and 6.1 (2.6-14.6) per copy of -1131C and -3G, respectively, and 24.6 (8.4-72.0) and 24.4 (8.4-70.9) in -1131C and -3G homozygotes, respectively, as compared to wild-type homozygotes. The 1891T>C (rs2266788) SNP was in LD (r(2)=0.68) with -1131T>C and -3A>G, and the minor allele was more frequent in FCH than controls (0.42 vs. 0.19, P<0.001). The 553G>T (rs2075291) nonsynonymous variant was also associated with FCH (0.15 vs. 0.04, P=0.001) and, along with -3A>G (or -1131T>C) and 1891T>C, contributed to haplotypes predicting FCH. The two tightly linked SNPs, -1131T>C and -3A>G polymorphism were significantly associated with lipid traits in all subjects combined, with variant homozygous subjects having higher TG and LDL-C and lower HDL-C levels.

METHODS: We used a Mendelian randomization approach and genotyped 63,051 individuals from a prospective cohort study of the general Danish population, including 3323 subjects with symptomatic gallstones. We selected eight genetic variants in APOE, APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9affecting LDL-C. Furthermore, studies of APOE rs429358,rs7412, (defining ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles; 12 studies) and APOB rs693 (eight studies) were included in meta-analyses, the observational hazard ratio (HR) for symptomatic gallstone disease for the fifth versus first quintile of LDL-C was 0.94 (95%confidence interval: 0.76-1.17), despite a corresponding 134% increase in LDL-C . Furthermore, although individual genetic variants in APOE, APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9 associated with stepwise increases/decreases in LDL-C of up to +59% compared with non-carriers (p <0.001), none predicted the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.

However, the predictive power of the regression model for LDL-C improved when gene-BMI interaction and gene-BMI interaction plus gene-nutrient interaction were added (p = 0.04 and p = 0.032 for R(2) change, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: APOE genotypes, SFA intake, and obesity were found to be associated with blood lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population. Analysis of gene-diet and gene-obesity interactions did not confirm that the effects of diet and obesity on TC and LDL-C level significantly depended on APOE genotype.","CONCLUSIONS: APOE genotypes, SFA intake, and obesity were found to be associated with blood lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.",APOE genotypes,blood lipid levels,positive,weak
"Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) accounts for about 95% of all Alzheimer's disease cases. While the APOE ε4 variant seems to have unparalleled influence on increased LOAD risk, it does not explain all of the heritability of LOAD. In this study, we present the application of a cost-effective, pooled DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) to uncover genetic risk variants associated with LOAD in Polish women diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or well-defined LOAD. A group of 141 patients (94 LOAD and 47 MCI), as well as 141 controls, were assayed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Allele frequency distributions were compared using χ(2)-tests, and significantly associated SNPs at p < 0.0001 with a proxy SNP were selected. GWAS marker selection was conducted using PLINK, and selected SNPs were validated on DNA samples from the same cohort using KASPar Assays. In addition, to determine the genotype of APOE variants (rs429358, rs7412), a multiplex tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system was applied. The GWAS revealed nine SNPs associated with MCI and/or LOAD. Of these, the association of seven SNPs was confirmed by genotyping of individual patients. Furthermore, the APOE ε4 appeared to be a risk variant for LOAD, while the APOE ε3 showed a protective effect. Multivariate analysis showed association between rs7856774 and LOAD, independently from the effect of APOE variation.

"OBJECTIVE: GH deficiency (GHD) in adults is associated with an altered serum lipid profile that responds to GH replacement therapy (GHRT). This studyevaluated the influence of polymorphisms in genes related to lipid metabolism on serum lipid profile before and after 1 year of GHRT in adults. METHODS: In 318 GHD patients, total cholesterol (TC) serum concentrations, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides (TG) were assessed. Using a candidate gene approach, 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. GH dose was individually titrated to obtain normal serum IGF1 concentrations. RESULTS: At baseline, the minor alleles of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene SNPs rs708272 and rs1800775 were associated with higher serum TC and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene SNP rs7412 with lower TC concentrations; CETP SNPs rs708272, rs1800775, and rs3764261 and apolipoprotein B (APOB)gene SNP rs693 with higher serum HDL-C; APOE SNP rs7412, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) gene SNP rs10865710 with lower LDL-C, and CETP SNP rs1800775 with higher LDL-C; and APOE/C1/C4/C2 cluster SNP rs35136575 with lower serum TG. After treatment, APOB SNP rs676210 GG genotype was associated with larger reductions in TC and LDL-C and PPARG SNP rs10865710 CC genotype with greater TC reduction. All associations remained significant when adjusted for age, sex, and BMI.
