"Genetic variations in the human mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) mediate individual differences in response to pain and opiate addiction. We studied whether the common A118G (rs1799971) mu-opioid receptor single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with overdose severity in humans. In addition, we examined an SNP responsible for alternative splicing of OPRM1 (rs2075572). We assessed allele frequencies of the above SNPs and associations with clinical severity in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute drug overdose. This work was designed as an observational cohort study over a 12-month period at an urban teaching hospital. Participants consisted of consecutive adult ED patients with suspected acute drug overdose for whom discarded blood samples were available for analysis. Specimens were linked with clinical variables (demographics, urinetoxicology screens, clinical outcomes) then deidentified prior to genetic SNP analysis. Blinded genotyping was performed after standard DNA purification and whole genome amplification. In-hospital severe outcomes were defined as either respiratory arrest (RA; defined by mechanical ventilation) or cardiac arrest (CA; defined by loss of pulse). We analyzed 179 patients (61% male, median age 32) who overall suffered 15 RAs and four CAs, of whom three died.

"OBJECTIVE: Opioids are frequently used during mechanical ventilation for severe viral infection in infancy. Opioid receptors have immunomodulatory properties, but nothing is known about their antiviral effects. We therefore aimed to investigate the role of opioid receptors in virus-induced airwayinflammation. METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in OPRM1 and OPRD1 were genotyped in 465 infants with severe respiratory syncytialvirus infection and 930 control subjects. Subsequently, the mechanism by which opioid receptors affect clinical outcome in respiratory syncytial virusbronchiolitis was studied in BALB/c mice. Animals were injected daily with nalmefene, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, and infected by intranasal inoculation of respiratory syncytial virus 24 hrs after the first dose of nalmefene. The potential therapeutic effect of pharmaceutical opioids was studied using µ (DAMGO), κ (U50488), and Δ (DPDPE) opioid receptor agonists 48 hrs after infection. RESULTS: In our human study, the A118G singlenucleotide polymorphism rs1799971 was associated with respiratory syncytial virus disease severity (p = 0.015). In mice, nalmefene treatment increasedviral titers and was associated with more pronounced weight loss. Increased viral replication was associated with increased levels of cytokines andchemokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, enhanced bronchoalveolar cellular influx, and exaggerated lung pathology. Pharmaceutical opioids, in particular DPDPE, did not affect viral replication. They did induce a decreased influx of neutrophils, but an increased influx of lymphocytes and monocytesinto the bronchoalveolar lumen during respiratory syncytial virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Using a human study and an experimental model, we show that opioid receptor signaling has a potential beneficial role in the outcome of respiratory viral disease. We show that opioid receptor signaling is required to control respiratory syncytial virus replication and thereby to control disease severity. However, we also show that caution is required before using pharmaceutical opioids as anti-inflammatory or antiviral treatment of patients with viral respiratory infection.","RESULTS: In our human study, the A118G singlenucleotide polymorphism rs1799971 was associated with respiratory syncytial virus disease severity (p = 0.015).",rs1799971,respiratory syncytial,positive,weak
"The shared genetic basis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) was explored by investigating the association of candidate risk factors in neurotransmitter genes with both disorders.

"Using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach, we comprehensively tested genetic variants for association with phenotypes available for 70,061 study participants in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) network. Our aim was to better characterize the genetic architecture of complex traits and identify novel pleiotropic relationships. This PheWAS drew on five population-based studies representing four major racial/ethnic groups (European Americans (EA), African Americans (AA), Hispanics/Mexican-Americans, and Asian/Pacific Islanders) in PAGE, each site with measurements for multiple traits, associated laboratory measures, and intermediate biomarkers. A total of 83 single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were genotyped across two or more PAGE study sites. Comprehensive tests of association, stratified by race/ethnicity, were performed, encompassing 4,706 phenotypes mapped to 105 phenotype-classes, and association results were compared across study sites. A total of 111 PheWAS results had significant associations for two or more PAGE study sites with consistent direction of effect with a significance threshold of p<0.01 for the same racial/ethnic group, SNP, and phenotype-class. Among results identified for SNPspreviously associated with phenotypes such as lipid traits, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, 52 replicated previously published genotype-phenotype associations, 26 represented phenotypes closely related to previously known genotype-phenotype associations, and 33 represented potentially novel genotype-phenotype associations with pleiotropic effects. The majority of the potentially novel results were for single PheWAS phenotype-classes, for example, for CDKN2A/B rs1333049 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes in EA) a PheWAS association was identified for hemoglobin levels in AA. Of note, however, GALNT2 rs2144300 (previously associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in EA) had multiple potentially novel PheWAS associations, with hypertension related phenotypes in AA and with serum calcium levels and coronary artery disease phenotypes in EA.

RESULTS: An association between the OPRM variant and AD was detected (p = 0.022), in recessive (AA vs. GA/GG) and co-dominant (AA vs. GA) models of inheritance. An association between the OPRM variant and the DSM-IV criterion ""efforts to cut down or could not"" (p = 0.047) was found, but this did not remain significant after the correction for multiple testing.

"Schizophrenia is ranked among multifactor diseases in whose pathogenesis, besides environmental factors, an interplay of functional polymorphisms of a larger number of candidate genes is involved. Neurodevelopmental abnormities are among the most accepted hypotheses in the etiology of schizophrenia. Recently, the role of oligodendrocytes in the development of the cortex has been cited repeatedly. During their various phases of differentiation oligodendrocytes present on their surfaces diverse receptors, among others the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1). The study was focused on the relationship between the functional A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene (rs1799971) and schizophrenia in groups of 130 male patients and 452 male controls. An association study revealed yet unpublished statistically significant difference of allelic and genotypic frequencies between the control and patient groups<cs>.

"It has been suggested recently that molecules expressed both in the pancreas and hypothalamus, such as mu-opioid receptor 1 (OPRM1), could form an integrated brain-liver system, which may sense glucose levels and therefore contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Polymorphisms were tested for association with glucose tolerance (normal vs IFG and T2DM combined) by calculating a chi(2) statistic and corresponding P values, whereas associations with quantitative measures of glucose tolerance, IS and insulin secretion were tested using mixed linear models implemented in the MIXED procedure of sas (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Associations were found between 102T/C OPRM1 and indices of glucose tolerance and IS. Compared with T/T homozygotes, carriers of the OPRM1 C-102 variant exhibited a better glucose tolerance with a lower (P = 0.006) glucose area under the curve (AUC) following the OGTT and a better IS with a higher (P = 0.03) value of the Cederholm index, a numerical index of the curve relating glucose uptake to the log(10) plasma insulin levels during the OGTT.

"BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) and tau proteins play important roles in the pathological development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many studies have shown an association between the APOE gene and AD. Association between AD and the newly discovered saitohin (STH) gene, nested within the intron of the tau gene, has been reported. The present study aimed to elucidate the association between APOE and AD, and between STH and AD in our sample. METHODS: The functional polymorphisms, rs429358 and rs7412, in the APOE gene (which together define the epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 alleles), and the Q7R SNP in the STH gene, were genotyped in 369 patients with AD and 289 healthy European-Americans. The associations between these two genes and AD were analyzed in a case-control design. RESULTS: Consistent with previously reported results, the frequencies of theAPOE epsilon4 allele, epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype and epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype were significantly higher in AD cases than controls; the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype frequency was significantly higher in early-onset AD (EOAD) than late-onset AD (LOAD); the frequencies of the epsilon2 allele, epsilon3 allele, epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype and epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype were significantly lower in AD cases than controls. Positive likelihood ratios (LRs+) of APOE alleles and genotypes increased in a linear trend with the number of epsilon4 alleles and decreased in a linear trend with the number of epsilon2 or epsilon3 alleles. There was no significant difference in the STH allele and genotype frequency distributions between AD cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the epsilon4 allele is a dose-response risk factor for AD and the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was associated with a significantly earlier age of onset. Moreover, we found that the epsilon2 allele was a dose-response protective factor for AD and the epsilon3 allele exerted a weaker dose-response protective effect for risk of AD compared with epsilon2. In a clinical setting, APOE genotyping could offer additional biological evidence of whether a subject may develop AD, but it is not robust enough to serve as an independent screening or predictive test in thediagnosis of AD.

"Dopamine (DA) is considered to be an important neurotransmitter in the control of impulsive behavior, however, its underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of DA within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and has been suggested to play a role in the mediation of impulsive behavior. The COMT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 (Val158Met) Met allele has been shown to decrease COMT enzyme activity and is associated with improved PFC cognitive function (intelligence and executive functions). Studies have associated the rs4680 genotype with impulsivity as a symptom in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse. However, only a few studies have assessed the effects of rs4680 on impulsiveness in healthy subjects, the results of which remain controversial. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was applied to 82 healthy volunteers (including 42 females) who were genotyped for COMT rs4680. Subjects carrying the Met/Met genotype scored higher for the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning than carriers of the Val/Val genotype. No interaction between gender genotype was detected. Age, gender and education had no effect on the results. The COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype was associated with higher impulsivity on the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning. These results suggest that COMT enzyme activity may be important in the regulation of impulsiveness among young adults. Further studies involving larger samples should be conducted to confirm the results of the present study.",The COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype was associated with higher impulsivity on the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning.,rs4680 Met/Met,impulsivity,positive,weak
"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) have been found to be associated with myocardial infarction (MI). However, the effect of rs1333049:C>G in INK4 locus in familial hypercholesterolemia patients and on lipid profile of the patients has not been studied in Pakistan. We therefore investigated the association of SNP rs1333049:C>G with MI as well as familial hypercholesterolemia patients and also determined the effect of genotype on lipid levels in a northern Pakistani population. A case-control association study was performed in which 611 individuals (294 patients, 290 healthy controls and 27 patients from hypercholesterolemia families) were genotyped for rs1333049:C>G, using an Allelespecific polymerase chain reaction. We found a significant association of rs1333049:C>G with MI (χ(2)=22.3, p<0.001). The frequency of risk genotype CC was significantly different from the healthy controls (p<0.001, χ(2)=22.3). The risk allele C was at a higher frequency in the MI patients as compared to the controls (odds ratio [OR]=1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.22-1.96), p<0.001). The logistic regression analysis for the genotype distribution resulted in strong association of risk allele C with MI under recessive model (OR=3.17 (95% CI=1.85-5.44) p<0.001). When the data were further analyzed along the lines of gender, a significant association with both males and females was observed. The pleiotropic role of rs1333049 was revealed further when CCgenotype hypercholesterolemic individuals on statins were found to have a significantly lower TC, LDL-C and Tg levels as compared to the CG and GG individuals (p<0.05). The current study demonstrates a strong association of the ANRIL SNP (rs1333049) with MI as well as familialhypercholesterolemia patients in a northern Pakistani population and could be used as a useful genetic marker for the screening of MI in the general Pakistani population.",The current study demonstrates a strong association of the ANRIL SNP (rs1333049) with MI as well as familialhypercholesterolemia patients in a northern Pakistani population and could be used as a useful genetic marker for the screening of MI in the general Pakistani population.,rs1333049,hypercholesterolemia,neutral,zero
"UNLABELLED: Purpose: Although case-control studies have evaluated the role of variant inflammatory-related loci in prostate cancer, their impact is virtually unknown among men of African descent. To address this, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) on prostate cancer risk for men of African descent. METHODS: Forty-four SNPs in inflammatory cytokine-associated genes were evaluatedamong 814 African-American and Jamaican men (279 prostate cancer cases and 535 controls) using Illumina's Golden gate genotyping system. Individual SNP effects were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Four SNPs were modestly associated with prostate cancer after adjusting for age. In the total population, inheritance of the IL1R2 rs11886877 AA, IL8RB rs11574752 AA, TNF rs1800629 GA + AA, and TNF rs673 GA genotypesmodestly increased prostate cancer risk by 1.45 to 11.7-fold relative to the referent genotype.

However, these main effects did not persist after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data does not strongly support the hypothesis that inflammatory-related sequence variants influence prostate cancer risk among men of African descent.

"BACKGROUND: Although more than 100 non-HLA variants have been tested for associations with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in candidate genestudies, only a few have been replicated. We sought to replicate reported associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PTPN22, TNFA and MIF genes in a well-characterized cohort of children with JIA. METHODS:  We genotyped and analyzed 4 SNPs in 3 genes: PTPN22 C1858T (rs2476601), TNFA G-308A, G-238A (rs1800629, rs361525) and MIF G-173C (rs755622) in 647 JIA cases and 751 healthy controls. We tested for association between each variant and JIA as well as JIA subtypes. We adjusted for multiple testing using permutation procedures. We also performed a meta-analysis that combined our results with published results from JIA association studies. RESULTS: While the PTPN22 variant showed only modest association with JIA (OR = 1.29, p = 0.0309), it demonstrated a stronger association with the RF-positive polyarticular JIA subtype (OR = 2.12, p = 0.0041). The MIF variant was not associated with the JIA as a whole or with any subtype. The TNFA-238A variant was associated with JIA as a whole (OR 0.66, p = 0.0265), and demonstrated a stronger association with oligoarticular JIA (OR 0.33, p = 0.0006) that was significant after correction for multiple testing. TNFA-308A was not associated with JIA, but was nominally associated with systemic JIA (OR = 0.33, p = 0.0089) and enthesitis-related JIA (OR = 0.40, p = 0.0144). Meta-analyses confirmed significant associations between JIA and PTPN22 (OR 1.44, p <0.0001) and TNFA-238A (OR 0.69, p < 0.0086) variants. Subtype meta-analyses of the PTPN22 variant revealed associations between RF-positive, RF-negative, and oligoarticular JIA, that remained significant after multiple hypothesis correction (p < 0.0005, p = 0.0007, and p < 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed associations between JIA and PTPN22 and TNFA G-308A.

"BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and subclinical atherosclerosis among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A total of 645 patients fulfilling the American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised classification criteria for RA were studied. Patients were genotyped for the CCR5 rs333 polymorphism using predesigned TaqMan assays. Also, HLA DRB1 genotyping was performed using molecular-based methods. Carotid intima-media thickness, flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent vasodilatation, which were used as surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, were measured in a subgroup of patients with no clinical CV disease. RESULTS: A lower frequency of carriers of the CCR5Δ32 allele among patients with CV events (3.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.025, odds ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.06 to 0.89) was observed. However, after adjusting for gender, age at time of RA diagnosis, and the presence of shared epitope, rheumatoid factor and classic CV risk factors in the Cox regression analysis, this reduction of CV events in CCR5Δ32 allele carriers was slightly outside the range of significance (P = 0.097; hazard ratio 0.37 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.19)). Carriers of the CCR5Δ32 deletion also showed higher FMD values than the remaining patients (CCR5/CCR5Δ32 patients: 7.03% ± 6.61% versus CCR5/CCR5 patients: 5.51% ± 4.66%). This difference was statistically significant when analysis of covariance was performed (P = 0.024).

"UNLABELLED: Gastric cancer is mainly initiated by inflammation and chronic superficial gastritis, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is an inflammatory cytokine which plays an important role in the inflammation. TNF-α rs1800629 G/A polymorphism was proposed to be associated withgastric cancer risk, but previous studies on Caucasians reported conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the association between TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism and gastric cancer risk in Caucasians. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval(95 % CI) was calculated to assess the association. Eleven case-control studies with 7,427 subjects were finally included into the meta-analysis. Overall,TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism was significantly associated with the increased risk of gastric cancer under four genetic comparison models (A versus G: OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.12-1.56, P = 0.001; AA versus GG: OR = 1.76, 95 % CI 1.37-2.26, P < 0.001; AA versus GG/GA: OR = 1.62, 95 % CI 1.27-2.07, P < 0.001; AA/GA versus GG: OR = 1.35, 95 % CI 1.14-1.60, P = 0.001). Meta-analysis of those studies with high quality showed that TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism was still significantly associated with the increased risk of gastric cancer under four genetic comparison models. There was no risk of publication bias in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis suggests that TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of gastric cancer in Caucasians.",The meta-analysis suggests that TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of gastric cancer in Caucasians.,rs1800629,gastric cancer,positive,strong
"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) are two chronic conditions, very common in aged men, that have been associated to inflammatory process. Chemokines and their receptors are recognized as critical mediators of inflammatory responses, they regulate immune cell migration and are implicated in tumor pathogenesis. The impact of two chemokine receptor gene polymorphisms, CCR2-64I (rs1799864) and CCR5-Δ32 (rs333), was evaluated in BPH and PCa. 385 DNA samples (130 BPH, 136 PCa, 119 healthy control) were genotyped. The allele frequencies were similar among control, BPH and PCa groups. Median of serum PSA levels was different between groups: 0.79, 1.45 and 6.91ng/mL in control, BPH and PCa groups, respectively (all p<0.001). The prostate volume median was 20.00cm(3) in the control group, thus, lower than BPH (35.35cm(3)) and PCa (35.80cm(3)) (both p<0.001), nevertheless no statistical significant difference was observed between BPH and PCa patients (p=0.172). Remarkably, CCR2-64I was a protective factor to PCa when compared with BPH (OR=0.550; 95%CI=0.311-0.975), although the statistically significant difference was lost after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant associations of CCR5-Δ32 variant were observed with BPH, PCa or PCa clinicopathologic status.

All subjects were genotyped for 13 polymorphic variants in the genes of xenobiotics detoxification CYP1A1 (rs2606345, rs4646903, and rs1048943), GSTM1 (Ins/del), GSTT1 (Ins/del), ABCB1 rs1045642); immune and inflammation response IL-6 (rs1800795), TNF-a (rs1800629), MBL2 (rs7096206), CCR5 (rs333), NOS3 (rs1799983), angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE (rs4340), and occlusive vascular disease/hyperhomocysteinemia MTHFR (rs1801133). Seven polymorphic variants in genes CYP1A1, GSTM1, ABCB1, NOS3, IL6, CCR5 and ACE were associated with CAP. For two genes CYP1A1 and GSTM1 associations remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Multiple analysis by the number of all risk genotypes showed a highly significant association with CAP (P=2.4×10(-7), OR=3.03, 95% CI 1.98-4.64) with the threshold for three risk genotypes. Using the ROC-analysis, the AUC value for multi-locus model was estimated as 68.38.","Seven polymorphic variants in genes CYP1A1, GSTM1, ABCB1, NOS3, IL6, CCR5 and ACE were associated with CAP.",CCR5,CAP,positive,weak

"OBJECTIVE: The selection of the most appropriate treatment for several diseases relies on a number of factors such as environment, age, gender, and nutrition. Additionally, the contribution of different genetic polymorphisms to treatment efficacy has been largely recognized. The lack of information on the pharmacogenetic profile of our population prompted us to analyze the frequency of polymorphisms known to be relevant to achieve treatment efficacy with different therapeutic agents in viral infectious diseases, such as Hepatitis C and AIDS. RESULTS: The allelic frequencies for the wild-type variant of the genes analyzed were cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6; rs3745274; 516G) 0.618 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.523, 0.711), chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5; rs333) 0.961 (95% CI: 0.942, 0.98), histocompatibility complex P5 (HCP5; rs2395029; 335T) 0.971 (95% CI: 0.937, 1), and interleukin 28B (IL28B; rs12979860; 12007005C) 0.656 (95% CI: 0.564, 0.747), respectively.

"Numerous reports have identified genetic variants associated with kidney transplant outcome, but only a few have been validated in subsequent studies. We analyzed the association of 21 previously reported genetic variants associated with acute rejection (AR), in an effort to validate these associations in our kidney transplant population. All recipients (n = 585) received Ab induction, rapid discontinuation of prednisone, and calcineurin inhibitors with either mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus. Both univariate analysis and logistic regression were used for determining the association between the genotypes and AR.

"In this study, we investigated 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the common genetic variation in 16 genes recurrently regarded as candidates for human longevity: APOE; ACE; CETP; HFE; IL6; IL6R; MTHFR; TGFB1; APOA4; APOC3; SIRTs 1, 3, 6; and HSPAs 1A, 1L, 14. In a case-control study of 1,089 oldest-old (ages 92-93) and 736 middle-aged Danes, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs769449 (APOE) was significantly decreased in the oldest-old, while the MAF of rs9923854 (CETP) was significantly enriched. These effects were supported when investigating 1,613 oldest-old (ages 95-110) and 1,104 middle-aged Germans. rs769449 was in modest linkage equilibrium (R (2)=0.55) with rs429358 of the APOE-ε4 haplotype and adjusting for rs429358 eliminated the association of rs769449, indicating that the association likely reflects the well-known effect of rs429358. Gene-based analysis confirmed the effects of variation in APOE and CETP and furthermore pointed to HSPA14 as a longevity gene. In a longitudinal study with 11 years of follow-up on survival in the oldest-old Danes, only one SNP, rs2069827 (IL6), was borderline significantly associated with survival from age 92 (P-corrected=0.064). This advantageous effect of the minor allele was supported when investigating a Dutch longitudinal cohort (N=563) of oldest-old (age 85+). Since rs2069827 was located in a putative transcription factor binding site, quantitative RNA expression studies were conducted. However, no difference in IL6 expression was observed between rs2069827 genotype groups. In conclusion, we here support and expand the evidence suggesting that genetic variation in APOE, CETP, and IL6, and possible HSPA14, is associated with human longevity.","In a longitudinal study with 11 years of follow-up on survival in the oldest-old Danes, only one SNP, rs2069827 (IL6), was borderline significantly associated with survival from age 92 (P-corrected=0.064).",rs2069827,survival,positive,moderate
"In recent years levels of a number of inflammatory markers namely C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) etc. are measured for the purpose of postinfarction risk evaluation. Dynamics of inflammatory markers concentrations can reflect processes occurring in atherosclerotic plaque and coronary arteries. Concentrations of inflammatory markers depend particularly on genetic factors affecting transcription levels of individual genes. This data suggest that genotypes which determine increased inflammatory markers levels in blood can increase risk of unfavorable events after myocardial infarction.

"Pharmacogenetic analyses of treatments for alcohol dependence attempt to predict treatment response and side-effect risk for specific medications. We review the literature on pharmacogenetics relevant to alcohol dependence treatment, and describe state-of-the-art methods of pharmacogenetic research in this area. Two main pharmacogenetic study designs predominate: challenge studies and treatment-trial analyses. Medications studied include US FDA-approved naltrexone and acamprosate, both indicated for treating alcohol dependence, as well as several investigational (and off-label) treatments such assertraline, olanzapine and ondansetron. The best-studied functional genetic variant relevant to alcoholism treatment is rs1799971, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the OPRM1 gene that encodes the μ-opioid receptor. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that the presence of the variant Gallele of rs1799971 may predict better treatment response to opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone. Evidence from clinical trials also suggests that several medications interact pharmacogenetically with variation in genes that encode proteins involved in dopaminergic and serotonergicneurotransmission. Variation in the DRD4 gene, which encodes the dopamine D(4) receptor, may predict better response to naltrexone and olanzapine. A polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 promoter region appears related to differential treatment response to sertraline depending on the subject's age of onset of alcoholism. Genetic variation in SLC6A4 may also be associated with better treatment response to ondansetron. Initialpharmacogenetic efforts in alcohol research have identified functional variants with potential clinical utility, but more research is needed to further elucidate the mechanism of these pharmacogenetic interactions and their moderators in order to translate them into clinical practice.","The best-studied functional genetic variant relevant to alcoholism treatment is rs1799971, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the OPRM1 gene that encodes the μ-opioid receptor.",rs1799971,alcoholism,positive,moderate

"OBJECTIVE: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is a potential candidate in altering risk for preeclampsia due to the important enzymatic effects in the metabolism of steroid hormones. It contains a non-synonymous G-A base change at codon 158 in the membrane bound isoform, which leads to a valine-to-methionine amino acid substitution. In the soluble isoform the polymorphism rs4680 is located in codon 108. The variant allele is the Met (A)allele and the Val (G) allele is the wild type allele. Despite its previously reported association with preeclampsia in genotypes in three selected ethnic groups, further studies in other populations are required. METHODS: We genotyped the Val158Met polymorphism in the COMT gene by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) analysis in a Chinese population.

"BACKGROUND: Although smoking has a known association with hot flashes, the factors distinguishing smokers at greatest risk for menopausalsymptoms have not been well delineated.

It is currently not known whether the impact of smoking on hot flashes is modified by the presence of such variants. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between smoking and hot flash occurrence as a function of genetic variation in sex steroid-metabolizing enzymes. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Penn Ovarian Aging study, an ongoing population-based cohort of late reproductive-aged women, was performed. Smoking behavior was characterized.

The identification of individuals with a genetic susceptibility to smoking-related menopausal symptoms could contribute to interventions targeted at reducing reproductive morbidity both in the menopause and across the reproductive life course.","African-American single-variantCYP 1A2  carriers who smoked were more likely to report  hot flashes than the nonsmoking carriers (AOR 6.16, 95% CI 1.11-33.91).",CYP 1A2 ,hot flashes,positive,weak
"OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to test the association between the Val158Met polymorphism rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene andanorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: First, an association study on two cohorts (306 cases and 1009 controls from Utrecht, and 174 cases and 466 controls from Leiden/NTR) was performed. Subsequently, the results were integrated into a meta-analysis, together with all the case-control and family-based studies, which were testing the same hypothesis and were available in the literature. Altogether, eight studies (11 datasets) were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 2021 cases, 2848 controls, and 89 informative (heterozygous) trios. RESULTS: The present association studies found no association between AN and rs4680 when testing the allelic contrast [Utrecht odds ratio (OR)=1.14, P=0.14; Leiden OR=1.02, P=0.85].

"BACKGROUND: The COMT enzyme metabolizes catecholamines and thus modulates adrenergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic signaling. A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding this enzyme, i.e. the COMT Val158Met SNP that reduces enzyme activity, has previously been linked to pain sensitivity. METHODS: We examined if the COMT Val158Met SNP could contribute to discogenic subacute low back pain and sciatica by comparing the frequency of the Val158Met genotypes of degenerative disc disease patients with healthy controls. Moreover, we examined if this SNP could predict the clinical outcome, i.e. the progression of pain and disability. RESULTS: The present data demonstrated that there were no differences in COMT genotypefrequencies between the newly diagnosed patients and controls. Analysis of pain and disability in the patients over time revealed, however, a significant or border-line significant increase in McGill sensory score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score for individuals with COMT Met/Met genotype. Furthermore, significant associations between the COMT Met-allele and VAS activity score, McGill sensory score and ODI score were observed in thepatients 6 months after inclusion.

"BACKGROUND: CYP1B1 is a P450 enzyme which is involved in the activation of pro-carcinogens to carcinogens as well as sex hormone metabolism. Because differences in the activity of the enzyme have been correlated with variant alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), it represents an attractive candidate gene for studies into colorectal cancer susceptibility. METHODS: We genotyped 597 cancer patients and 597controls for threeCYP1B1 SNPs, which have previously been shown to be associated with altered enzymatic activity. Using the three SNPs, eight different haplotypes were constructed. The haplotype frequencies were estimated in cases and controls and then compared. The odds ratio for each tumour type, associated with each haplotype was estimated, with reference to the most common haplotype observed in the controls. RESULTS: The three SNPs rs10012, rs1056827 and rs1056836 alone did not provide any significant evidence of association with colorectal cancer risk. Haplotypes of rs1056827 and rs10012 or rs1056827 and rs1056836 revealed an association with colorectal cancer which was significantly stronger in the homozygous carriers.

"In our previous proteomic study in rat liver damaged by carbon tetrachloride, soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) increased as a phosphorylatedform and decreased as a dephosphorylated form. This finding raised the possibility that the COMT protein is associated with liver function.  Thus, we hypothesized that (1) the COMT gene contributes to liver homeostasis and (2) a COMT polymorphism (rs4680: Val158Met) causing thermolability of enzymatic activity affects liver enzymes (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)) in serum. To investigate (2), we statistically analyzed the association between COMT genotypes and serum ALT activity in a cross-sectional studyusing data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. We conducted a multiple logistic regression analysis for males (n=838) and females (n=970). Those participants having missing values or a past history of liver cirrhosis or liver cancer were excluded. ALT values were divided into two; elevated (30IU/L ≤; males n=239, females n=90) and normal (<30IU/L; males n=599, females n=880). In females, non-adjusted and adjusted odds ratios for ALT values in the rs4680 A/A homozygote (n=126) compared with the wild-type G/G homozygote (n=397) were 0.37 (95% CI 0.14-0.96) and 0.34 (95% CI 0.13-0.93), respectively. In males, an analysis of the population aged 35-69 did not reveal any significant difference, but the population aged 45-54 had a significant difference in the non-adjusted and adjusted odds ratio in the G/A heterozygote (n=89) (0.50 (95% CI 0.27-0.92) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.18-0.71)) and in the A/A homozygote (n=22) (0.34 (95% CI 0.11-0.99) and 0.22 (95% CI 0.07-0.72)), compared with the G/G homozygote (n=88). These data suggest that the COMT polymorphism affects serum ALT activity to maintain liver function.","Thus, we hypothesized that (1) the COMT gene contributes to liver homeostasis and (2) a COMT polymorphism (rs4680: Val158Met) causing thermolability of enzymatic activity affects liver enzymes (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)) in serum.",rs4680,liver homeostasis,positive,weak
"BACKGROUND: It is well established that COMT is a strong candidate gene for substance use disorder and schizophrenia.  Recently we identified two SNPs in COMT (rs4680 and rs165774) that are associated with schizophrenia in an Australian cohort.  Individuals with schizophrenia were more than twice as likely to carry the GG genotype compared to the AA genotype for both the rs165774 and rs4680 SNPs. Association of both rs4680 and rs165774 withsubstance dependence, a common comorbidity of schizophrenia has not been investigated. METHODS: To determine whether COMT is important insubstance dependence, rs165774 and rs4680 were genotyped and haplotyped in patients with nicotine, alcohol and opiate dependence. RESULTS:  The rs165774 SNP was associated with alcohol dependence. However, it was not associated with nicotine or opiate dependence. Individuals with alcohol dependence were more than twice as likely to carry the GG or AG genotypes compared to the AA genotype, indicating a dominant mode of inheritance. The rs4680 SNP showed a weak association with alcohol dependence at the allele level that did not reach significance at the genotype level but it was not associated with nicotine or opiate dependence.  Analysis of rs165774/rs4680 haplotypes also revealed association with alcohol dependence with the G/Ghaplotype being almost 1.5 times more common in alcohol-dependent cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides further support for the importance of theCOMT in alcohol dependence in addition to schizophrenia.  It is possible that the rs165774 SNP, in combination with rs4680, results in a common molecular variant of COMT that contributes to schizophrenia and alcohol dependence susceptibility. This is potentially important for future studies ofcomorbidity.

The rs4680 SNP showed a weak association with alcohol dependence at the allele level that did not reach significance at the genotype level but it was not associated with nicotine or opiate dependence.  Analysis of rs165774/rs4680 haplotypes also revealed association with alcohol dependence with the G/Ghaplotype being almost 1.5 times more common in alcohol-dependent cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides further support for the importance of theCOMT in alcohol dependence in addition to schizophrenia.  It is possible that the rs165774 SNP, in combination with rs4680, results in a common molecular variant of COMT that contributes to schizophrenia and alcohol dependence susceptibility.

"Elevated mammographic density (MD) is strongly associated with breast cancer risk and the estrogen pathway has been proposed as a potential mechanism for this association.

"Dopaminergic system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to regulate the cognitive functions. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), one of the major modulators of prefrontal dopamine function, has emerged as an important determinant of schizophrenia associated cognitive dysfunction and response to antipsychotics. A common Val->Met polymorphism (rs4680) in the COMT gene, associated with increased prefrontal dopamine catabolism, impairs prefrontal cognition and might increase risk for schizophrenia. Further, the degree of cognitive improvement observed with antipsychotics in schizophrenia patients is influenced by the COMT activity, and Val/Met has been proposed as a potential pharmacogenetic marker. However, studies evaluating the role of COMT have been equivocal. The presence of other functional polymorphisms in the gene, and the observed ethnic variations in the linkage disequilibrium structure at COMT locus, suggest that COMT activity regulation might be complex. Despite these lacunae in our current understanding, the influence of COMT on PFC mediated cognitive tasks is undeniable. COMT thus represents an attractive candidate for novel therapeutic interventions for cognitive dysfunction. The COMT activity inhibiting drugs including tolcapone and entacapone, have shown promising potential as they selectively modulate dopaminergic transmission. This review is an attempt to summarize the rapidly evolving literature exploring the diverse facets of COMT biology, its functional relevance as a predictive marker and a therapeutic target for schizophrenia.","A common Val->Met polymorphism (rs4680) in the COMT gene, associated with increased prefrontal dopamine catabolism, impairs prefrontal cognition and might increase risk for schizophrenia.",rs4680,schizophrenia,positive,weak
"BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MAMP) use is highly associated with psychiatric disorders with 12-13% of MAMP-dependent patients experiencing psychotic symptoms. Substance abuse and dependence may primarily involve the mesolimbic pathway and dopaminergic brain structures. It follows that dopaminergic genes, particularly COMT (encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase) and its val158met polymorphism (rs4680), are natural candidates for susceptibility loci to addiction. We have previously found an association with rs4680 and MAMP addiction. METHODS: We present additional genotypingof rs165599 in 423 cases and 502 controls of a Taiwanese MAMP user sample. We carried out an in-silico evaluation of rs165599 for a possible impact onmicroRNA binding or UTR stability. We also carried out a review of transcript sequences across the COMT 3'UTR. RESULTS: Genotype counts were (cases/controls): AA 94/110, AG 198/210 and GG 93/109. There were no significant allele or genotype differences between cases and controls for rs165599. However, a haplotype main effect was detected using both rs4680 and rs165599 using the χ²-test in UNPHASED. The global P-value was P=0.0044 with the effect appearing to derive from one haplotype that is underrepresented in cases: A/G for rs4680/rs165599 (haplotype P=0.001). rs165599 is a single nucleotide polymorphism located in the COMT 3' untranslated region (UTR), a noncoding transcript region subject to posttranscriptional down-regulation by mechanisms such as microRNA binding. A review of transcript sequences across the COMT 3'UTR found evidence to suggest antisense interference of COMT from the 3'UTR of the neighbouring 'Armadillo repeat gene deleted in velocardiofacial syndrome' gene.",We have previously found an association with rs4680 and MAMP addiction.,rs4680,MAMP,positive,weak
"The OPRM1 gene encodes the µ-opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action of most opioids. Several studies and three meta-analyses have examined a possible link between the exonic OPRM1 A118G (rs1799971) polymorphism and opioid dependence; however, results have been inconclusive. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis have been carried out to examine whether this polymorphism is associated with opioid dependence. Thirteen studies (n = 9385), comprising 4601 opioid dependents and 4784 controls, which evaluated association of the OPRM1 rs1799971 polymorphism with susceptibility to opioids, were included in this study. Our meta-analysis showed significant association between this polymorphism and susceptibility to opioid dependence in overall studies under a codominant model, as well as susceptibility to opioid dependence or heroin dependence in Asians under an autosomal dominant model.

In the French D.E.S.I.R. cohort, a high consumption of dairy products was associated with a lower body weight gain over 9-years, and with a lower incidence of high plasmaglucose levels and/or the metabolic syndrome. Our aim was to test in this study, the association of rs4988235 with BMI and related metabolic diseases, in interaction with dairy product consumption. METHODS: Among 5212 subjects from D.E.S.I.R., 3575 Caucasians born in mainland France were genotyped and followed over 9years. RESULTS: Those with the LP genotype (frequency: 78.5%) had a higher dairy product consumption, at inclusion and at year-9 (P<0.001). They also had a higher BMI at both time points (difference=0.3kg/m(2), P=0.05), but this effect was restricted to medium/high dairyproduct consumers (difference=0.5kg/m(2), P=0.006). This genotype was also associated with the metabolic syndrome (IDF definition), but this association disappeared after adjustment for BMI. In the whole population, the C allele was associated with a higher prevalence of impaired fastingglycemia and/or type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The lactase persistence genotype was shown to be associated with a higher BMI in a longitudinal study, mainly in those consuming high amounts of dairy products.

"BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations of the filaggrin (FLG) gene cause an impaired skin barrier and increase the risk of atopic dermatitis. Interestingly, FLG mutations have also been found to be associated with a high risk of peanut allergy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of FLG mutations with self-reported food allergy, symptoms of oral allergy syndrome (OAS), and alcohol sensitivity. METHODS: A total of 3,471 adultsfrom the general population participated in a health examination. Information on food allergies, OAS and alcohol sensitivity was obtained byquestionnaire. FLG mutation carriers were defined as having at least one null mutation allele of R501X or 2282del4. Primary lactose intolerance (PLI) was defined as the C/C genotype of the rs4988235 polymorphism. RESULTS: FLG mutations were associated with a higher risk of self-reported allergy to eggs (OR 3.22 and 95% CI 1.46-7.11), milk (OR 2.10 and 95% CI 1.12-3.92), fish (OR 4.54 and 95% CI 1.88-10.96) and wheat (OR 3.59 and 95% CI 1.61-8.02), but not with symptoms of OAS (OR 1.05 and 95% CI 0.73-1.51). Serum-specific IgE was measured in a subsample and confirmed the association between FLG and IgE to milk. A significant gene-by-gene interaction between FLG and PLI was observed in relation to self-reported allergy to milk. Furthermore, FLG mutations were associated with a higher risk of alcohol sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: We found that loss-of-function mutations in the FLG gene were significantly associated with self-reported food allergy and alcohol sensitivity, but not with OAS. These findings, if confirmed, support the idea that skin barrier functions may be involved in the pathogenesis of food allergy..",Primary lactose intolerance (PLI) was defined as the C/C genotype of the rs4988235 polymorphism.,rs4988235,Primary lactose intolerance,positive,moderate
"Childhood obesity is a worldwide health concern with a multifaceted and sometimes confounding etiology. Dairy products have been implicated as both pro- and anti-obesogenic, perhaps due to the confounding relationship between dairy, lactose consumption, and potential genetic predisposition.

"High dairy protein intake has been found to be associated with increased prostate cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). To further examine this possible relationship, we investigated the hypothesis that a genetic polymorphism in the lactase (LCT) gene might be associated with elevated dairy product intake and increased prostate cancer risk in a case-control study nested in EPIC. The C/T-13910 lactasevariant (rs4988235) was genotyped in 630 men with prostate cancer and 873 matched control participants. Dairy product consumption was assessed by diet questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) for prostate cancer in relation to lactase genotype were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Lactasegenotype frequency varied significantly between countries, with frequencies of the T (lactase persistence) allele ranging from 7% in Greece to 79% inDenmark. Intake of milk and total dairy products varied significantly by lactase genotype after adjustment for recruitment center; adjusted mean intakes of milk were 44.4, 69.8 and 82.3 g/day among men with CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively.

"BACKGROUND: -Variants at the 9p21 locus associate with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial infarction (MI). However, atherosclerotic plaque deposition is distinct from MI (plaque rupture and thrombosis) and recent studies showed no association between these variants and MI in patients with preexisting CAD. We performed haplotype analysis at the 9p21 locus to test whether haplotypes at distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks predict these phenotypes. METHODS AND RESULTS: -Using 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in Caucasians without diabetes, we reconstructed haplotypes at the 9p21 locus. Angiographic CAD/MI patients had at least 1 epicardial stenosis > 50% (n=2352) whereas controls were asymptomatic and over age 60 (n=2116). For CAD patients, regression models examined association of haplotypes with initial age of symptomatic CAD, number of diseased vessels, and history of MI. In the case-control study, only haplotypes at one block tagged by rs1333049 associated with CAD more so than MI. These haplotypes also associated with early onset of CAD (β=-0.13 p=1.37*10(-4)) and disease severity (β=0.1823, p=0.006), but not with prevalent MI among CAD patients. In contrast, haplotypes at another block tagged by rs518394 associated with prevalent MI (β=0.239, p= 2.05*10(-4)), but remarkably these are inversely associated with disease severity (β=-0.196, p=0.003). This MI association was replicated in the Cleveland Clinic GeneBank premature CAD cohort (n=1385, β=0.207, p= 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: -Variants/haplotypes at two blocks are distinguished at 9p21, those at one block predispose to atherosclerosis whereas those at the other predispose to MI among individuals with preexisting CAD.","In contrast, haplotypes at another block tagged by rs518394 associated with prevalent MI (β=0.239, p= 2.05*10(-4)), but remarkably these are inversely associated with disease severity (β=-0.196, p=0.003).",rs518394,MI,positive,strong

"BACKGROUND: Preoperative pain, type of operation and anesthesia, severity of acute postoperative pain, and psychosocial factors have been identified as risk factors for chronic postsurgical pain (CPP). Recently, it has been suggested that genetic factors also contribute to CPP. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and opioid receptor μ-1 (OPRM1) common functional polymorphisms rs4680 and rs1799971were associated with the incidence, intensity, or duration of CPP in patients after lower abdominal surgery. METHODS: One hundred and two patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I/II underwent either abdominal radical prostatectomy (n = 45) or hysterectomy (n = 57). Theincidences of CPP in the pelvic and scar areas were evaluated in all patients three months after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-five (34.3%) patientsexperienced CPP after lower abdominal surgery. Within this group, six (17.1%) patients demonstrated symptoms of neuropathic pain. For COMT rs4680, 22 (21.6%) patients had Met158Met, 55 (53.9%) patients had Val158Met, and 25 (24.5%) patients had Val158Val.

"Guided by the affective spillover hypothesis and the differential susceptibility to environmental influence frameworks, the present study examined how associations between interparental conflict and mothers' parenting practices were moderated by serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR)genes.

Mothers with one or two copies of the 5-HTTLPR S allele demonstrated differential susceptibility for both sensitive and harsh/punitive caregiving behaviors. Finally, analyses examined whether maternal depressive symptoms and emotional closeness to their child mediated the moderating effects. Findings suggest that maternal emotional closeness with their child indirectly linked OXTR with maternal sensitivity.

"Much evidence of an association between specific attachment styles and depression prompted us to investigate, in depressive disorders, the potential role of polymorphisms within the gene encoding the receptor of the main neurohormone involved in attachment processes, oxytocin.

"The oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) has been studied in autism because of the role of oxytocin (OT) in social cognition. Linkage has also been demonstrated to the region of OXTR in a large sample. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a haplotype constructed from them in OXTR have been associated with autism in the Chinese Han population. We tested whether these associations replicated in a Caucasian sample with strictly defined autistic disorder. We genotyped the two previously associated SNPs (rs2254298, rs53576) in 57 Caucasian autism trios. Probands met clinical, ADI-R, and ADOS criteria for autistic disorder. Significant association was detected at rs2254298 (p=0.03) but not rs53576. For rs2254298, overtransmission of the G allele to probands with autistic disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample. In both samples, G was more frequent than A. However, in our Caucasian autism trios and the CEU Caucasian HapMap samples the frequency of A was less than that reported in the Chinese Han and Chinese in Bejing HapMap samples. The haplotype test of association did not reveal excess transmission from parents to affected offspring. These findings provide support for association of OXTR with autism in a Caucasian population. Overtransmission of different alleles in different populations may be due to a different pattern of linkage disequilibrium between the marker rs2254298 and an as yet undetermined susceptibility variant in OXTR.","For rs2254298, overtransmission of the G allele to probands with autistic disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample.",rs2254298,autistic,positive,weak

"BACKGROUND: Previous research has suggested that the social impairments exhibited by individuals with autism are associated with changes in plasma oxytocin (OT) levels. The physiologic effects of oxytocin are mediated through its specific receptors (OTRs), and numerous studies have implicated OTRs in the regulation of social cognition and behavior. Animal models and linkage data from genome screens indicate that the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is an excellent candidate for research concerning psychiatric disorders, particularly those involving social impairments, such as autism. METHODS: We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the OXTR gene of 195 Chinese Han autism trios, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: The family-based association test (FBAT) revealed a significant genetic association between autism and two of the SNPs tested (rs2254298 A: Z = 2.287, p = .0222; rs53576 A: Z = 2.573, p = .0101). When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, the haplotype-specific FBAT revealed that a number of haplotypes, particularly those involving rs53576, were significantly associated with autism. Furthermore, haplotypes constructed with all markers showed a significant excess transmission for the specific and global haplotype analyses (p = .0020 and .0289, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an involvement of OXTR in the susceptibility to autism, and replication is important.","When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, the haplotype-specific FBAT revealed that a number of haplotypes, particularly those involving rs53576, were significantly associated with autism.",rs53576,autism,positive,strong
"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown an association between polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene (AR) and the risk forandrogenetic alopecia (AGA), but the overall results are still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine, by conducting a meta-analysis, whether the common AR gene polymorphisms confer susceptibility to AGA. METHODS: Publications addressing the association between AR gene polymorphisms and risk for AGA were selected from the PubMed, EMBASE and CBMdisc databases. Data were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. The meta-analysis was performed using the software programs RevMan (version 5.0.25) and STATA (version 9.2). From these data, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Only eight studies were found, reporting a total of 2074 patients with AGA and 1115 healthy controls. Three common polymorphisms of the AR gene were addressed: a StuI restriction-site polymorphism (rs6152, G>A), and CAG and GGC triplet-repeat polymorphisms. Meta-analysis results identified a significant association between the G allele of the AR StuI polymorphism and the risk for AGA (OR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.71-4.19, P < 0.01), especially in white populations (OR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.71-4.45, P < 0.01). No association was found between theCAG or GGC polymorphism and the risk for AGA (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.49-1.34, P = 0.41; OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.47-2.14, P = 0.99, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the G allele of AR StuI polymorphism might be a potential risk factor for AGA, especially in whitepopulations. However, we did not find any obvious association of the CAG and GGC triplet-repeat polymorphisms of the AR gene with risk for AGA.","CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the G allele of AR StuI polymorphism might be a potential risk factor for AGA, especially in whitepopulations.",AR StuI,AGA,positive,weak

MetS and control allelic frequencies for rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333049 were statistically different (p < 0.05). The rs2383207 AG variant, was identified as a MetS risk factor (p = 0.012, OR = 33.271; 95 % CI: 2.193-504.805) and the AA haplotype in block 1 and the GC, AG haplotypes in block 2 were associated with MetS (χ (2) = 3.875, p = 0.049; χ (2) = 9.334, p = 0.0022; χ (2) = 9.134, p = 0.0025, respectively). In this study, we found that chromosome 9p21 SNP rs10757278 and related haplotypes correlate with MetS risk. This is the first report showing an association between a 9p21 variant and MetS and suggests that rs10757278 polymorphism may confer increased risk for disease.","MetS and control allelic frequencies for rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333049 were statistically different (p < 0.05).",rs1333049,MetS,positive,moderate
"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common multifactorial disorder that involves abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Genome-wide association studies have identified a major risk locus for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction on chromosome 9p21. Here, we examined the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9p21 in a sample of Turkish patients with MetS and further investigated the correlation between regional SNPs, haplotypes, and MetS.

"Genetic variation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene may be associated with endometrial cancer risk based on the role of AR in regulating androgenlevels.

"The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) binds exogenous and endogenous opioids and is known to mediate the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. Numerous genetic studies have sought to identify common genetic variation in the gene encoding MOR (OPRM1) that affects risk for drug addiction. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of rare coding variants in OPRM1 to the risk for addiction. Rare and low frequency variants were selected using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute - Exome Sequencing Project (NHLBI-ESP) database, which has screened the exomes of over 6500 individuals. Two SNPs (rs62638690 and rs17174794) were selected for genotyping in 1377 European American individuals addicted to heroin and/or cocaine. Two different SNPs (rs1799971 and rs17174801) were genotyped in 1238 African American individuals addicted to heroin and/or cocaine. Using the minor allelefrequencies from the NHLBI-ESP dataset as a comparison group, case-control association analyses were performed. Results revealed an association between rs62638690 and cocaine and heroin addiction in European Americans (p=0.02; 95% C.I. 0.47 [0.24-0.92]). This study suggests a potential role for rare OPRM1 variants in addiction disorders and highlights an area worthy of future study.",Results revealed an association between rs62638690 and cocaine and heroin addiction in European Americans (p=0.02; 95% C.I.,rs62638690,addiction,positive,weak
